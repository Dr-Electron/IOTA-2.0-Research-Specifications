# Standard Payloads Layout

## Payloads
Payloads can contain arbitrary data up to `MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE` that can be defined by the user and that allow to build additional protocols on top of the base protocol in the same way as TCP/IP allows to define additional protocols on top of its generic data segment.

Payloads can recursively contain other payloads, which enables the creation of higher level protocols based on the same concepts of layers, as in traditional software and network architecture.

Payloads other than transactions are always liked with level of knowledge 3. 

### User-defined payloads
A node can choose to interpret user-defined payloads by listenting to its specific **payload type** (possibly via third-party code/software). If a node does not know a certain **payload type**, it simply treates it as arbitrary data.

### Core payloads
The core protocol defines a number of payloads that every node needs to interpret and process in order to participate in the network.

- **Transactions:** Value transfers that constitute the ledger state. 
- **dRNG:** Messages that contain randomness or committee declarations.
- **FPC:** Opinions on conflicts of transactions and timestamps of the messages, mainly issued by high mana nodes.
