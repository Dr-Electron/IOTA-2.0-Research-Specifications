# 3.2 Bootstrapping

The module presented in this specification, bootstrapping, allows a new node to join the network. 
This process is the first action undertaken by the node and includes:
finding other nodes in the network; obtaining the ledger; obtaining information needed to find neighbors; and identify the dRNG committee.
To do so the new nodes rely on the entry nodes.



The bootstrapping process has the following phases: 

1. Entry information gathering

2. Neighbor selection

3. Ledger
