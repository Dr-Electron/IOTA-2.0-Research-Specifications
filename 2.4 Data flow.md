# 2.3 Bird's Eye View of the Protocol

This section describes the life cycle of a message on a node also known as data flow from message creation up until acceptance in the Tangle.
The Tangle as a replicated, shared and distributed data structure, emerges through a combination of deterministic rules, cooperation, and voting.
In essence, this section is a high-level description of the protocol where its distinct components and their interactions are explained to yield an overview. 
The following explanations are given from the point of view of a single node but are executed by each (honest) node participating in the network.

## Network Layer

## Communication Layer

## (Decentralized) Application Layer










## Message Creation
A node can create messages with a certain pace according to aPoW and Congestion Control Rate setter.

Explain necessary steps to issue message

Any message, created locally, or received from a neighbor needs to pass through the data flow.

### Parser

### Storage

### Solidifier

#### Message Requester
