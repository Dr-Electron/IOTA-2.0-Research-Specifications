# 2.3 Bird's Eye View of the Protocol

This section provides a high-level description of the IOTA protocol, its components and their interactions. The protocol enables reliable, trustless, and feeless communication of data and value via the IOTA token. Similarly to other DLTs, the protocol can be divided in three main elements P2P overlay network, immutable data structure, and consensus mechanism, wired together via game-theoretic and economic incentives. 
In the IOTA protocol these are abstracted into layers where upper layers build on functionality of the layers below.

## Network Layer (P2P Overlay Network)
- pure P2P system, i.e., all nodes perform the same actions in contrast to miners/validators

## Communication Layer (Immutable Data Structure & Ledger, Consensus Mechanism)
The Tangle as a replicated, shared and distributed data structure, emerges through a combination of deterministic rules, cooperation, and (virtual) voting.
- Nakamoto consensus -> heaviest branch, pre-consensus via fcob/FPC


## (Decentralized) Application Layer 












## Message Creation
A node can create messages with a certain pace according to aPoW and Congestion Control Rate setter.

Explain necessary steps to issue message

Any message, created locally, or received from a neighbor needs to pass through the data flow.



## Data Flow
This section describes the life cycle of a message on a node also known as data flow from message creation up until acceptance in the Tangle.
