# Introduction

To orientate the reader, we provide a brief summary of the Iota 2.0 protocol. The network will be maintained via the Networking layer which consists of two basic modules: the peer discovery module which provides a list of nodes actively using the network, and the neighbor selection (aka autopeering) which actually picks links. The Networking layer also manages the gossiping.

  

The communication layer concerns the information communicated through the network layer. All information exchanged in the Iota 2.0 are contained in objects called messages. To prevent the network from being overloaded, the rate control and congestion control modules control how many messages are created and which messages gossiped. Messages will be stored in the message tangle, whose DAG structure secures all the data. The processing specification describes how messages must be processed in order to meet the demands of the other components.

  

On top of the communication layer is the application layer. There are several core applications which must be run by all nodes. The most important application is the Value Transfer Application which maintains the ledger state and the mana held by each node.  Specifically, this application maintains a separate tangle called the value tangle, a DAG whose vertices are called value objects, and whose refere approval.  

  

Several core applications provide consensus and regulate timestamps in the message tangle and conflicts in the value tangle (a component of the value transfer application). FPC or Fast Probabilistic Consensus is a binary voting protocol which produces consensus on a bit. The “implementing FPC” specification outlines how this binary voting protocol is used to vote on actual objects. The FPC protocol relies on a DRNG, aka a distributed random number generator. Lastly, the resynchronization application detects any FPC failures.
