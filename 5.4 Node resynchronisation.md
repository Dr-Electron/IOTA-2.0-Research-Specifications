The module presented in this specification allows for the node's resynchronization of the node with the network after as a result of the failure of the consensus mechanism.  Currently, the consensus mechanism for IOTA 2.0 is the Fast Probabilistic Consensus (FPC) (see Section 5.1). FPC was extensively researched and from it we concluded that it is secure even in the byzantine  environment - adversary controls the certain number of nodes in the network and intends to either delay or break the consensus. 


Due to its probabilistic nature, it is possible that a small number of nodes finalise FPC on an opposite opinion to the majority of the network. The role of the resynchronisation mechanism is to provide an automatic response to such event. Without such mechanism, the only alternative would be to manually restart the node. 


Note that the it is accurate to say that the resynchronisation procedure, together with FPC, redefines the consensus mechanism. To avoid the creation on new attack vectors on the consensus, the resynchronisation was designed to only be triggered when very strong evidence suggests that the node had a termination failure. 



The resynchronization procedure is divided into two steps:

1. Trigger step (evidence gathering);

2. Query step (opinion switching).



During the trigger step, the node periodically gathers evidence of potential transactions that finalised FPC on the wrong opinion . If this evidence is strong enough, the Query Step is called.

The Query Step is performed by querying a large part of the network of the network about the mentioned transaction. If the result of the query confirms the findings of the trigger step, then the node perform resynchronisation.

Resynchronisation protocol

## 5.4.3.1 Variables and parameters 

### Mana associated with reality

How do we know what mana is online?

## Query for the best reality 


# Resynchronisation protocol

## Variables and parameters 






`current_reality` Reality. Currently used reality.



`incom_tx_reality` Transaction. Transaction associated with currently used reality. 



`mana_response` Real number. The ratio of online mana that responded to node's query in the second step of the protocol. 



### Parameters 







`minimal_abs_mana_to_swich` Minimal absolute value of mana associated with reality $X$ (which is not current reality) required to go to step 2 (querry) ofd resynchronisation. 


`minimal_ratio_mana_to_swich` Minimal ratio of mana associated with reality $X$ (which is not curent reality) to mana of the curent reality required to go to step 2 (querry) odf resynchronisation. 


`mana_query`  Real number between 0 and 1. The ratio of online mana that node queries to synchronize in step 2 of resynchronization.



`min_mana_response` Real number between 0 and 1. The minimal required ratio of online mana that responded to a query in step 2 that allows for a continuation of the resynchronization process.



`query_parameter` Real number between 0 and 1. The parameter used in the query step of resynchronization. If a conflicting reality received more than `query_parameter` of mana weighted votes from the current reality then the node switches to the conflicting reality. 




# 5.4.4 Functions



`who_to_query(mana_ratio)`  one input: real number `mana_ratio`. Output is a list of random, online nodes with `mana_ratio` ratio of online mana.


`query_resynch_step2(tx1,tx2,set_of_nodes)` Subroutine. Takes 3 inputs: two transactions `tx1` and `tx2`; set of nodes to query `set_of_nodes`. Subroutine queries nodes from `set_of_nodes` about transactions `tx1` and `tx2`. Queried nodes respond to which transaction they like: `tx1`, `tx2`, or neither. Subroutine modifies 3 variables: `mana_response`; `query_result1`; `query_result2`. `mana_response` is equal to the ratio of online mana of nodes that responded to query. `query_result1` is a ratio of nodes who responded to query with like for transaction `tx1`; `query_result2` is a ratio of nodes who responded to query with like for transaction `tx2`.


 `swich_to_reality(tx)` Subroutine. Takes one input: one transaction. Subroutine switches reality from `current_reality` to the reality associated with the transaction `tx`. 





## 5.4.4.1 Pseudocode

Trigger Step:
```
if (incom_tx_reality =/= current_reality) then
    mana_associated_with_reality (incom_tx_reality) =+ mana_associated_with_tx (incom_tx)
    
    logical_1 = mana_associated_with_reality (incom_tx_reality) >  minimal_abs_mana_to_swich
    logical_2 = mana_associated_with_reality (incom_tx_reality) >  minimal_ratio_mana_to_swich * mana_associated_with_reality (current_reality) 
   
    if (logical_1 .AND. logical_2 ) then
      CALL Resynch_query(incom_tx,current_tx)
    fi   
fi
```
<!--- 
if (local_time mod timestep) then
    for con_real in conflicting_realities
        tx1 = reality_identifier(con_real) 
        tx2 = reality_identifier(curent_reality)
        t_0 = max(timestamp(tx1),timestamp(tx2))
        if (issued_mana(con_real,t_0,local_time) -issued_mana(curent_reality,t_0,local_time) > trigger_parameter) then 
           CALL Resynch_query(tx1,tx2)
        fi
     endfor
fi

--------------------------------
Query step: 
Pseudocode of `Resynch_query(tx1,tx2)` subroutine

```
subroutine Resynch_query(tx1,tx2) 
   set_of_nodes = who_to_query(mana_query)
   mana_response =0
   do while (mana_response < min_mana_response)
      set_of_nodes = who_to_query(mana_query)
      CALL query_resynch_step2(tx1,tx2,set_of_nodes)
   endwhile
   if (query_result1 - query_result2 > query_parameter) then
      CALL swich_to_reality(tx1)
   fi
endsubroutine   
```

## 5.4.4.2 Timescale and priority of resynch messages

Resynchronization protocol is supposed to be used with extreme caution. Moreover, it should be activated only with a very small probability. As such, the node which resynchronizes can wait a long time before finally deciding to switch a reality. Thus we conclude that the resynchronization messages can have lower priority in responding than other messages. Also, the time window when the node who queries other nodes in the second step of resynchronization can be bigger, even of the order of minutes. 





## 5.4.4.3 Values of the parameters

` minimal_abs_mana_to_swich` = We don't know yet, we are waiting for the testnet with mana data. Probably not less than 1000Gi i.e.: mana associated with 1Gi sitting on one address for 3 years

`minimal_ratio_mana_to_swich` = 3.0


`query_parameter` = 0.5

`mana_query` = 0.75 

`min_mana_response` = 0.5
