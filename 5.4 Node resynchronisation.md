# 5.4 Node resynchronisation in IOTA network - Specification 




This specifiaction is part of [Coordicide](https://coordicide.iota.org/).



The module presented in this specification, resynchronization, allows for the node's resynchronization of the node with the network after it was desynchronized. Desynchronisation might be a result of the failure of the consensus mechanism.  Currently, the consensus mechanism for the first version of the coordicade is Fast Probabilistic Consensus (FPC), for more see [FPC-BI: Fast Probabilistic Consensus within Byzantine Infrastructures"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10895) and [specification of FPC modue](https://hackmd.io/s/HkFbpbTrU). Researchers at IF researched FPC thoroughly and deduced that this consensus mechanism is secure even in the Byzantine environment - adversary controls the certain number of nodes in the network and intends to either delay or break the consensus. However, due to its probabilistic nature, it is possible that with certain very small (although nonzero) probability, several a small number of nodes finalize FPC on the opposite opinion different than the prest ofvailing in the network - fork occurs. For the details of such an event, we recommend reading through the simulations papers:  ["Robustness and efficiency..."](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08787) and ["Fast Probabilistic Consensus with Weighted Votes"](https://www.overleaf.com/project/5e3a96c9ebfeb20001821bb5) where this probability and improvements to the protocol are discussed.



The role of the resynchronization role is to provide an automatic response to such an eventof a node which fell out of synch. Without this mode, the only alternative would be to manually "kill" the node and set it up again. 



Note that the resynchronization mechanism can, in fact, "overwrite" FPC as it is a new finalization procedure on top of FPC. This opens the protocol for new attack vectors. WithHaving this in mind, we designed the rResynchronizsation as a procedure startedwhich is taken only whenif very strong evidence suggests that the node is out of synch. 



The resynchronization procedure is divided into two steps:

1. Trigger step (evidence gathering)

2. Query step (actual resynchronization)



During the first one, node periodically gathers evidence of potential falling out of synch. If this with the network. If enough evidence is gathe case,red the node tries to confirm the possibletential falling out of synch. This is done by the and query ofies the majority of the network about it. If the result of the query confirms the findings of the trigger step, then the node adapts resynchronizesation.

# Resynchronisation protocol

### Variables and parameters 






`current_reality` Reality. Currently used reality.



`incom_tx_reality` Transaction. Transaction associated with currently used reality. 



`mana_response` Real number. The ratio of online mana that responded to node's query in the second step of the protocol. 



### Parameters 







`minimal_abs_mana_to_swich` Minimal absolute value of mana associated with reality $X$ (which is not current reality) required to go to step 2 (querry) od resynchronisation. 


`minimal_ratio_mana_to_swich` Minimal ratio of mana associated with reality $X$ (which is not curent reality) to mana of the curent reality required to go to step 2 (querry) od resynchronisation. 


`mana_query`  Real number between 0 and 1. The ratio of online mana that node queries to synchronize in step 2 of resynchronization.



`min_mana_response` Real number between 0 and 1. The minimal required ratio of online mana that responded to a query in step 2 that allows for a continuation of the resynchronization process.



`query_parameter` Real number between 0 and 1. The parameter used in the query step of resynchronization. If a conflicting reality received more than `query_parameter` of mana weighted votes from the current reality then the node switches to the conflicting reality. 




# 5.4.4 Functions



`who_to_query(mana_ratio)`  one input: real number `mana_ratio`. Output is a list of random, online nodes with `mana_ratio` ratio of online mana.


`query_resynch_step2(tx1,tx2,set_of_nodes)` Subroutine. Takes 3 inputs: two transactions `tx1` and `tx2`; set of nodes to query `set_of_nodes`. Subroutine queries nodes from `set_of_nodes` about transactions `tx1` and `tx2`. Queried nodes respond to which transaction they like: `tx1`, `tx2`, or neither. Subroutine modifies 3 variables: `mana_response`; `query_result1`; `query_result2`. `mana_response` is equal to the ratio of online mana of nodes that responded to query. `query_result1` is a ratio of nodes who responded to query with like for transaction `tx1`; `query_result2` is a ratio of nodes who responded to query with like for transaction `tx2`.


 `swich_to_reality(tx)` Subroutine. Takes one input: one transaction. Subroutine switches reality from `current_reality` to the reality associated with the transaction `tx`. 





## 5.4.4.1 Pseudocode

Trigger Step:
```
if (incom_tx_reality =/= current_reality) then
    mana_associated_with_reality (incom_tx_reality) =+ mana_associated_with_tx (incom_tx)
    
    logical_1 = mana_associated_with_reality (incom_tx_reality) >  minimal_abs_mana_to_swich
    logical_2 = mana_associated_with_reality (incom_tx_reality) >  minimal_ratio_mana_to_swich * mana_associated_with_reality (current_reality) 
   
    if (logical_1 .AND. logical_2 ) then
      CALL Resynch_query(incom_tx,current_tx)
    fi   
fi
```
<!--- 
if (local_time mod timestep) then
    for con_real in conflicting_realities
        tx1 = reality_identifier(con_real) 
        tx2 = reality_identifier(curent_reality)
        t_0 = max(timestamp(tx1),timestamp(tx2))
        if (issued_mana(con_real,t_0,local_time) -issued_mana(curent_reality,t_0,local_time) > trigger_parameter) then 
           CALL Resynch_query(tx1,tx2)
        fi
     endfor
fi

--------------------------------
Query step: 
Pseudocode of `Resynch_query(tx1,tx2)` subroutine

```
subroutine Resynch_query(tx1,tx2) 
   mana_response =0
   do while (mana_response < min_mana_response)
      set_of_nodes = who_to_query(mana_query)
      CALL query_resynch_step2(tx1,tx2,set_of_nodes)
   endwhile
   if (query_result1 - query_result2 > query_parameter) then
      CALL swich_to_reality(tx1)
   fi
endsubroutine   
```

## 5.4.4.2 Timescale and priority of resynch messages

Resynchronization protocol is supposed to be used with extreme caution. Moreover, it should be activated only with a very small probability. As such, the node which resynchronizes can wait a long time before finally deciding to switch a reality. Thus we conclude that the resynchronization messages can have lower priority in responding than other messages. Also, the time window when the node who queries other nodes in the second step of resynchronization can be bigger, even of the order of minutes. 





## 5.4.4.3 Values of the parameters

` minimal_abs_mana_to_swich` = We don't know yet, we are waiting for the testnet with mana data. Probably not less than 1000Gi i.e.: mana associated with 1Gi sitting on one address for 3 years

`minimal_ratio_mana_to_swich` = 3.0


`query_parameter` = 0.5

`mana_query` = 0.75 

`min_mana_response` = 0.5
