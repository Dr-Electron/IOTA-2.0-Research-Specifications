# 5.3 Decentralised Random Number Generator
  
  
  
The module presented in this specification, allows for the decentralised generation of randomness for the IOTA 2.0 network. The dRNG protocol is divided into three phases. In the first phase, a committee of high mana nodes is selected.  In the second setup phase, the committee members create a collective private key used in the third, beacon phase, where the random numbers are published in the Tangle.  
  
During the committee selection, we do not assume a perfect agreement on the mana values, i.e., different nodes can have slightly different opinions on the mana values of other nodes. Obtaining the consensus on the mana values is the central part of this documentation. In the setup phase, a pair of collective private and public key is created in such a way that no individual committee member knows the entire private key. This is done using $(t,n)$ Distributed Key Generation (DKG), which does not rely on centralized, trusted third parties. In the beacon phase, messages containing random numbers can be signed with the private collective key when at least $t$ of the $n$ committee nodes sign a message with their private key share. All of the random number messages used in three phases are published in the Tangle.

# 5.3.2 Outline 
  
**1. COMMITTEE SELECTION:**  
  
a) Nodes declare willingness to be a committee member with a special ''application'' message  
  
b) Selection of $n$ top mana holders  
  
  
**2. DKG PHASE:**  
  
Distributed key generation phase. Takes place on the Tangle, participation can be publicly verified.  
  
**3. PUBLICATION PHASE:**  
  
Publication of the beacon messages in the Tangle  
  
  
  
  
  
  
# 5.3.3 Parameters  
  
  
  
  
  
1. The random number production frequency: $t_{ran}$  
  
*Random number is produced every $t_{ran}$ seconds.*  
  
  
  
2. Number of participating nodes: $m, m_2$.* The committee's size from top mana holders equals $m$; the size of the pre-selected committee (responsible for random backup number) equals $m_2$.*
  
  
  
3. Committee seat sizes: $n, n_2$  
  
*The number of identities (seats) in the mana committee equals $n$. $n$ does not equal $m$ as specific nodes receive more than one seat, i.e., node publishes more than one beacon message.*  
  
  
  
4. Signature threshold parameter: $f \in [0,1]$ (percentage), $t \in \mathbb{N}$ (number of beacon messages needed to obtain randomness)  
  
*In order to find the next random number, $t$ or more beacon messages are required. $\left ($t =\lfloor nf \rfloor +1 \right )$).*  
  
  
  
5. Frequency of committee update: `Freq`.  
  
*The committee is selected every `Freq` units of time.*  
  
  
  
6. Time window of the ''application'' message submission: $\Delta_A$  
*Nodes at want to be    have to issue a special ''application'' message in the angle within the time window, which lasts for $\Delta_A$   units of time.*  
  
  
  
7. Time delay bound on the dRNG messages: $D_{RN}$  
  
*The network does not accept the dRNG messages with the timestamp off by more than $D_{RN}$ from node's local time. Derived from the protocol specification.*  
  
8. Size of $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ group: $p$  
  
  
  
# 5.3.5  Committee selection  
  
  
  
  
To select the  mana committee, we need a consensus on the mana values. Unfortunately, different nodes have different views on mana, due to the slightly different clocks.  
  
The Tangle graph in IOTA 2.0 lacks an obvious 'reference point,' which could be used to calculate mana values. This is not a problem in blockchains where such a reference point could be every $k$-th block; neither it is a problem in IOTA 1.0 where milestones could be such reference. To solve this problem, we use the timestamps of the transactions and use a specific time as a reference point. Application messages are used to determine whether the node wants to participate in the committee, then the committee is formed from the $n$ highest mana holders.  
 
  
## 5.3.5.1 Application messages  
  
  
  
Application messages have to be submitted within a time window of $\Delta_A$ units of time.  
  
In general, any node can issue an application message, and such a message would be accepted by the Tangle (assuming it passes rate control). However, we admit that for a low mana node, such behaviour does not make much sense. Such nodes can decide not to take part in it. Multiple application messages are allowed. However, they are pointless and, in fact, costly as they have to pass the rate control mechanism.  
  
  
  
Assume that the committee should be formed at the time $t_0$. Remember that $D_{RN}$ is bound o accepting dRNG messages in the angle. Then no honest node accepts dRNG message with the timestamp different by more than $D_{RN}$ from its local time.  
Let us denote  
  
$$  
T_0 = t_0 - D_{RN}.  
$$  
  
Then we require the potential committee members to issue an application message in the Tangle with a timestamp in the interval 
  
$$
[T_0 -\Delta_A, T_0].
$$
					
  
The mana value of all nodes would be calculated for the time $T_0$ (reference point).  
  
  
  
For nodes interested in committee participation, e provide a default application algorithm that tells node when to apply. Nodes can modify it; however, we encourage them to stick with it as it reduces the number of exchanged application messages.  
  
  
A node is said to be $M_\ell$ if it is among top $\ell$ top mana nodes (with respect to the time $T_0 -\Delta_A$).  
  
  
  
If a node $x$ is $M_{2m}$ then it issues an application at the time $T_0-\Delta_A$.  
  
  
for a $k >2$ a node $x$ is $M_{m\cdot k}$ but not $M_{m\cdot (k-1)}$ ($m$ is committee size) then it submits a committee application if before the time $T_0- \Delta_A \frac{\ell-2}{\ell-1}$ there is less than $m$ valid application messages with mana greater than $x$.  
  
  
  
Pseudocode:  
```  
if (this_node_wants_to_participate_in_dRNG) then  
	if (time == T_0-Delta_A)  
		ell = what_is_my_ell_number(my_ID,MANA_vector)  
		CALL APPLICATION_MESSAGE_SEND(ell)  
	fi  
fi  
```  
  
```  
subroutine APPLICATION_MESSAGE_SEND(ell)  
if (ell <= 2) then  
	timestamp = T_0-Delta_A  
	send_application_message(timestamp)  
else  
	wait_untill(T- Delta_A *(ell-2)/(ell-1))  
	if (number_of_valid_application_messages_with_mana_higher_than_mine < m) then  
		send_application_message(timestamp)  
	fi  
fi  
endsubroutine  
```  
  
  
  
If $m$ or more vared. hoe eses a not e for comtee frmatlid apnesses hd been issued to the Tangle, thenantopta ndhei is considered valid, and the committee is formed from top $m$ mana nodes who applied.  
  
  
  
If committee selection was a failure, then the procedure should be repeated until success In general if the failed committee selection was supposed to end at time $t_n$ then the procedure is repeated with a new expected ti__aa (imeofiection $t_ __Dei fisuroutine __N{n+_A$  
  
  
  
# 5.3.6 DKG phase  
  
After successful committee selection, confirmed at the time $t_0, the DKG phase starts. In this phase, committee nodes exchange the *Deal messages* to produce a public/private collective key. Nodes should proceed with DKG message exchange as soon as committee selection is confirmed (time $t_0$).  
  
  
If any committee node refuses to create a collective key pair by not exchanging Deal DKG messages, the DKG phase fails. This can be confirmed at the time of $t_0 + D_{RN}$. Moreover, since the message exchange occurs on the Tangle, everybody can identify nodes that caused the failure. In DKG phase failure, the entire committee selection is repeated. The malicious node can then be excluded from the new committee on process by modifying mana to zero. This modification is applied only to the mana used in dRNG module. Mana values used for other purposes are unchanged. Moreover, modification is lifted after the committee is *successfully* selected,

i.e., the  committee produces its first beacon messages.  
  
  
If DKG phase failure is confirmed a the time $t_n + D_{RN}$, then the committee selection is repeated with a new expected time of committee selection $t_{n+1} = t_n +2\times D_{RN}+\Delta_A$.  
 
Our research revealed that we could increase the security of dRNG beacon by granting double seats for half of  with the highest mana. Those nodes would receive two private keys (identities) with which they sign beacon messages in the Tangle. From the technical point of view, two seats are completely separate, and issued messages can not be combined (even though physically signed by the same node). This modification increases mana required to "overtake" the committee, which is understood as gaining $t$ of seats in the committee. Without it, an attacker could gain more than $t$ seats in the committee with about 12% mana for $m=15$. With double seat proposal, minimal mana to overtake doubles.  
  
  
The total number of nodes with double seats equals $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ which makes the total number of identities in the committee equal  
  
$$  
n + \lfloor n/2 \rfloor = \left \lfloor 1\frac{1}{2}n \right \rfloor.  
$$  
  
  
  
  
  
  
# 5.3.8 Synchronisation of the new committee & duties of the old committee  
  
Before starting random number generations, committee nodes should synchronise their clocks, with each other or some other central entity like atomic clock services.  
  
The old committee should stop producing randomness only if the new committee was successfully selected and started producing random numbers. This is confirmed when $t$ or more beacon messages are produced by the new committee and can be read directly from the Tangle.  
  
  
  
# 5.3.9 Community dRNG  
  
Although unlikely, it is still possible that the mana committee fails to produce a random number. To increase liveness of the random number production in the IOTA 2.0, we will deploy multiple dRNG, which uses the same scheme, but the committee is pre-selected from community members. Details of the random number usage from different sources in FPC are described in specification 5.1.  
  
  
In the future, we also want to deploy backup randomness beacon based on VDFs.  
  
  
  
# 5.3.10 Collective beacon message  
  
To recover the random number from beacon messages node needs to perform Lagrange interpolation. Although not very computationally costly, this procedure would need to be completed by each node in the network.  
  
  
  
To avoid that, we propose nodes produce the collective beacon message which contains already computed random number (committee nodes perform Lagrange interpolation on their own). Since the committee size is small and the expected number of TPS for IOTA large, we require all committee members to produce this collective beacon message as soon as they receive $t$ beacon messages. 
  
  
  
  
The cost of getting randomness from collective beacon would be reduced as only the signature verification would be required.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Non-committee nodes behave as follows: If randomness is required at the time, when no collective beacon is available but more than $t$ beacon messages are published, then the nodes perform Lagrange interpolation themselves.

# 5.3.14 Committee failure and RN recoverability



We designed our dRNG messages in such a way that the secret-revealing, beacon messages contain an additional bit of information called `Rec.` (recoverability). The value of this bit is `0` if in the last round given nodes was able to recover the RN from the messages issued by other committee members i.e.: whether the node received at least `t` beacon messages in time (Value of `Rec.` can be also set to zero based on other premises. For example when the node knows that some of the committee members were compromised.


If the committee failed and stopped producing RN then all of the other nodes in the network use lower instance RN, while the committee takes appropriate actions. Active and honest committee members drop out of the current committee and apply for the membership in the new one. 





Committee member deduces that in the last round the committee failed to produce random number if more than `tau` fraction of the beacon messages contain `Rec. = 0`. The trigger for dropping out of the committee is a situation in which node deduces that the RN was not produced for `rho` rounds in a row. Note that in the environment of the committee failure, when nodes receive less than `tau` fraction of the messages it is not feasible to run any consensus mechanism (like pBFT) as all of them can withstand up to the `1/3` of faulty nodes.
