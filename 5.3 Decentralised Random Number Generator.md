# 5.3 Decentralised Random Number Generator for IOTA network - Specification


This specificction is part of IOTA 2.0 [Coordicide](https://coordicide.iota.org/).

The module presented in this specification, decentralized random number generator (dRNG), allows for the decentralized generation of randomness used in IOTA network. The dRNG protocol is divided into two parts. In the first part, we provide a committee selection method. The committee is selected from the high mana nodes, however, we do not assume perfect agreement on the mana values (different nodes can have slightly different opinions on the mana values of other nodes). In the second part, the committee members use drand scheme to produce the random number. Drand is based on a combination of verifiable secret sharing scheme and a threshold signature scheme and requires committee members to publish messages with part of the randomness. Those messages are published in the Tangle. In the context of IOTA network, decentralized random numbers are required to FPC consensus mechanism and arrow autopeering (both important for the Coordicide).
The module presented in this specification, decentralized rank of high mana nodes is selected. In the second phase the committee members create a he committee seecte dom nube allows for the decentralized generation of randomness for the IOTA 2.0 network. The dRNG protocol is divided into three phase pas. In the first phase, a committee of high mana nodes is selected. In the second setup phase, the cted committee members create a collective private key used in the third, beacon phase, where the random numbers are published in the Tangle.

We do not assume perfect agreement on the mana values, i.e.,   (different nodes can have slightly different opinions on the mana values of other nodes). ObtainingIn the seconsensus on the mana values is the central part of this documentationd part, the committee members use a verifiable secret sharing and the threshold signature scheme to produce andom number. IAn the setup phase, a pair of collective private and public key is created in such a way that no individual committee member knows the entire private key. This is done using $(t,n)$ Distributed Key Generation (DKG), which does not rely onexample of such protocol is *drand* where the committee publish random numbrsmembers publish *beacon messages* which contain part of the randomness. Those messages are published in the Tangle. In the IOTA 2.0 protocol, thenetwork, decentralized random numbers are used in the FPC. Possible, future use in other modules like autopeering, rate control or smart ceontralized, trusted third parties. In the beacon phase, messages containing random numbers can be signed with the private collective key when at least $t$ of the $n$ committee nodes sign a message with their private key share. All of the random number messages used in three phases are published in the angle


In the IOTA 2.0, decentralized random numbers are used in the FPC. Randomnesseats increases the securct, rate control, and certain autopeering protocols (are discussed.-row). 



# 5.3.1 Introduction


IOTA 2.0 requires a decentralized random number generator (dRot assue perfect agreement on the mna valuediferent nodes an hae slightly iffernt opinions on the mana value ofor e n such nodes have ''the skin in the game,'' and it would be in their interest to maintain the network's security. Such committee members would be updated periodically. Nevertheless, even those reliable nodes can have certain problems like DDOS attacks or connectivity issues. To improve the reliability of the network, we use a backup, secondary random number beacons. Currently, we do not plan to deploy them.

To provide the dRNG for IOTA 2.0, we decided to use already existing works, including [Rabin83](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022000083900429), [Shamir's Secret Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing); [Petersen secret sharing](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs754/2001fa/129.PDF); [Boneh–Lynn–Shacham (BLS) signature scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boneh%E2%80%93Lynn%E2%80%93Shacham); [Syta17](https://bford.info/pub/dec/random.pdf) and most notably open-source, practical implementation of dRNG: [drand](https://drand.love/). In this specification, we use the same cryptographic foundations as drand. The full specification of the drand protocol can be found here: https://github.com/drand/drand. We highly recommend reading it before continuing this specification. In particular the part responsiuse the committee of IOTA community nodes as our backup dRNG.

# 5.3.5 Committee selection




To select the high mana committee, we need a consensus on the mana values. Unfortunately, different nodes have different views on the mana values, due to the slightly different clocks.

The Tangle graph in IOTA 2.0 lacks an obvious 'reference point,' which could be used to calculate mana values. This is not a problem (level 3 bad).* in blockchains w, there such a reference point could be every $k$-is no perfect consensus on the block; neither it is a problem in IOTA 1.0 where milestones could be such reference. To solve this problem, we use the timestamps of the transactions and use a specific time as a reference point. Application messages are used to determine whether the node wants to participate in the committee, then the committee is formed from top $n$ highest mana holders.

The committee selection process is analyzed in-depth in this article:
https://www.overleaf.com/read/jdbhppqyxsvx
 (submitted to the conference, still in review)

In this article, we also describe alternative methods of committee selection and analyze DAG distributed ledgers other thaalances/mana and different nodes can have slightly different mana values. To achieve objective values of mana, we require all of the nodes interested in the committee participation to prepare a special ''application'' transaction, which determines it. Then the committee is formed from top $n$ highest mana holders.


## 5.3.5.1 Fixing mana perception



To obtain the consensus on the Tmangle.


## 5.3.5.1 Application messages



Application messages have to be submited within a time window of $\Delta_A$ units of time.

In general, any node can issue an application message, and such a message would be accepted by the Tangle (assuming it passes rate control). However, we admit that for a low mana node, such behavior does not make much sense. Such nodes can decide not to take part in it. Multiple application messages are allowed. However, they are pointless and, in fact, costly as they have to pass the rate control mechanisma value of the top nodes, we require them to submit application messages to the Tangle. Application message contains information about their mana.
 


Assume that the committee should be formed at the time $t_0$. Remember that $D_{RN}$ is bound on accepting dRNG messages in the Tangle. Then no honest node accepts dRNG message with the timestamp different by more than $D_{RN}$ from its local time.
Let us denote

$$
T_0 = t_0 - D_{RN}.
$$

Then we require the potential committee members to issue an application message in the Tangle with a timestamp from an interval.

$$
[T_0 -\Delta_A, T_0].
$$

The mana value of all nodes would be calculated for the time $T_0 -\Delta_A $ (reference point).



For nodes interested in committee participation, we provide a default application algori


If a node $x$ is $M_{2m}$ then it issues an application at the timetransaction with a timestamp $T_0-\Delta_A$.


ForIf  for a $k >2$ and a node $x$ which is $M_{m\cdot k}$ but not $M_{m\cdot (k-1)}$ ($m$ is the committee size) then it submits a committee application if before the time $T_0- \Delta_A \frac{\ell-2}{\ell-1}$ there is less than $m$ valid application messages with mana greater then $x$'s manamana of $x$. Node $x$ issues application message with a timestamp $T_0- \Delta_A \frac{\ell-2}{\ell-1}$.



Pseudocode:
```
if (this_node_wants_to_participate_in_dRNG) then
	if (time == T_0-Delta_A)
		ell = what_is_my_ell_number(my_ID,MANA_vector)
		CALL APPLICATION_MESSAGE_SEND(ell)
	fi 
fi
```

```
subroutine APPLICATION_MESSAGE_SEND(ell)
if (ell <= 2) then
	timestamp = T_0-Delta_A
	send_application_message(timestamp)
else
	wait_untill(T- Delta_A *(ell-2)/(ell-1))
	CALL what_is_my_mana
	if (number_of_valid_application_messages_with_mana_higher_than_mine < m) then
		send_application_message(timestamp)
	fi
fi
endsubroutine
```



If $m$ or more valid application messages had been issued to the Tangle, then the committee selection is considered valid, and the committee is formed from top $m$ mana nodes who applied.



If committee selection was a failure, then the procedure should be repeated until success In general if the failed committee selection was supposed to end at time $t_n$ then the procedure is repeated with a new expected time of committee selection $t_{n+1} = t_n + D_{RN}+\Delta_A$



# 5.3.6 DKG phase

After successful committee selection, confirmed at the time $t_0, the DKG phase starts. In this phase, committee nodes exchange the Deal messages to produce a public/private collective key. Nodes should proceed with DKG message exchange as soon as committee selection is confirmed (time $t_0$).


If any committee node refuses to create a collective key pair by not exchanging Deal DKG messages, the DKG phase fails. This can be confirmed at the time of $t_0 + D_{RN}$. Moreover, since the message exchange occurs on the Tangle, everybody can identify nodes that caused the failure. In the case of DKG phase failure, the entire committee selection is repeated. The malicious node can then be excluded from the new committee selection process by modifying the malicious node's mana to zero. This modification is applied only to the mana used in dRNG module. Mana values used for other purposes are unchanged. Moreover, modification is lifted after the committee is *successfully* selected, i.e., the new committee produces its first beacon messages.


If DKG phase failure is confirmed at the time $t_n + D_{RN}$, then the committee selection is repeated with a new expected time of committee selection $t_{n+1} = t_n +2*D_{RN}+\Delta_A$.



# 5.3.7 Double seats in the committee

Our research revealed that we could increase the security of dRNG beacon by granting double seats for half of the committee with the highest mana. Those nodes would receive two private keys (identities) with which they sign beacon messages in the Tangle. From the technical point of view, two seats are entirely separate, and issued messages can not be combined (even though physically signed by the same node). This modification increases mana required to "overtake" the committee, which is understood as gaining $t$ of seats in the committee. Without it, an attacker could gain more than $t$ seats in the committee with about 12% mana for $m=15$. With double seat proposal, minimal mana to overtake doubles.


The total number of nodes with double seats equals $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ which makes the total number of identities in the committee equal

$$
n + \lfloor n/2 \rfloor = \left \lfloor 1\frac{1}{2}n \right \rfloor.
$$






# 5.3.8 Synching of the new committee nodes & duties of the old committee

Before starting random number generations, committee nodes should synch up their clocks, with each other or some other central entity like atomic clock services.

The old committee should stop producing random numbers only if the new committee was successfully selected and started producing random numbers. This is confirmed when $t$ or more beacon messages are produced by the new committee and can be read directly from the Tangle.



# 5.3.9 Community dRNG

Although unlikely, it is still possible that the mana committee fails to produce a random number. To increase liveness of the random number production in the IOTA 2.0, we will deploy multiple dRNG, which uses the same scheme, but the committee is pre-selected from community members. Details of the random number usage from different sources in FPC are described in specification 5.1.


In the future, we also want to deploy backup randomness beacon based on VDFs.



# 5.3.10 Collective beacon message

To recover the random number from beacon messages node needs to perform Lagrange interpolation. Although not very computationally costly, this procedure would need to be completed by each node in the network.



To avoid that, we propose that committee nodes produce the collective beacon message which contains already computed random number (committee nodes perform Lagrange interpolation on their own). Since the committee size is small and the expected number of TPS for IOTA large, we require all committee members to produce this collective beacon message as soon as they receive $t$ beacon messages.




The cost of getting randomness from collective beacon would be reduced as only the signature verification would be required.






Non-committee nodes behave as follows: If randomness is required at the time when no collective beacon is available but more than $t$ beacon messages are published, then the nodes perform Lagrange interpolation themself.

## 5.3.5.2 Getting committee from mana perception

When enough application messages are in the Tangle, and there is a consensus on top holders' mana, we select  $m$ top mana holders to be in the committee. This approach is straightforward and seems to decrease the probability of malicious node getting into the committee (higher mana is required to be in the committee).




## 5.3.5.3 Message exchange phase - DKG

At the time $t_0, the Tangle does not accept application messages with the timestamps from the application interval. Thus there is an objective criterion for nodes that apply for the committee, and we can select one (pick the top $m$ nodes). 

After that, the message exchange phase begins were newly selected committee members are creating the distributed key. This phase lasts up to $\Delta_C$, and all of the messages are exchanged publically in the Tangle.

If successful, then before $t_0+\Delta_C$ distributed key should be generated. In the case of a malicious behavior/malfunction, a committee may fail to produce a distributed key. This failure can be confirmed at the time of $t_0+\Delta_C+\Delta_{RN}$. Thus at the time $t_0+\Delta_C+\Delta_{RN}$ committee either will be able to produce the first random number of will be able to confirm failure in the DKG phase. 



Assume that a particular node applied to be in a committee and got a seat. If this node refuses to create a distributed key by not exchanging messages, then the committee fails. In the case of committee selection, failure procedure is repeated (see below). The nodes which did not participate in the DKG message exchange are stripped of their dRNG mana (mana used for dRNG committee selection), i.e., this is done by modification of dRNG mana to 0 until next committee is *successfully* selected. Note that we are talking here only about committee mana, mana used for other purposes is unchanged.




## 5.3.5.4 Committee selection failure 


If at time $t_0+\Delta_C+\Delta_{RN}$ failure in the DKG phase is detected, then another attempt of selecting the committee takes place. This time the committee selection time is $t_1 =t_0+\Delta_C+\Delta_{RN}$ and window for application messages is again $\Delta_A$. Nodes produce application messages according to the same rules as for $t_0$. This can be generalised for $k$-th attempt to select the committee at the time $t_k = t_{k-1} + D_{RN} + \Delta_A+\Delta_C)$. In the worst-case scenario of constant DKG failures, the procedure is repeated until the committee update time (time at which committee would be updated in normal circumstances).



## 5.3.5.5 Double seats in the committee 

Our research revealed that if we assign equally important seats in the mana committee, our proposed protocol might be vulnerable for "overtaking" of the committee. An attacker could gain more than $t$ seats in the committee with relatively small mana (about 12% for $m=15$). To reduce this attack vector, we decided to grant double seats for half of the committee with the highest mana. Those nodes would receive two private keys (identities) with which they sign beacon messages in the Tangle. From the technical point of view, two seats are completely separate, and issued messages can not be combined (even though physically signed by the same node). This modification increases mana required to "overtake" the committee. The total number of nodes with double seats equals $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ which makes the total number of identities in the committee equal 

$$
n + \lfloor n/2 \rfloor = \left \lfloor 1\frac{1}{2}n \right \rfloor.
$$


## 5.3.5.6 Synching of committee nodes

Before starting random number generations, committee nodes should synch up their clocks, with each other or some other central entity like atomic clock services.



# 5.3.6 Backup options
Although unlikely, it is still possible that the mana committee fails to produce a random number. It can happen when the network is under attack or committee nodes are dealing with technical problems. Even reliable committee members may experience DDOS attacks. Although the threshold-signature scheme has built-in countermeasures for those cases - one needs only $t$ out of $n$ signatures (not all of the committee members are required to publish a secret-revealing message).  We want to make sure that the benefits from a random number (which include increased security) are going to be available even if a large number of committee members are compromised.


As we already pointed out, the random number used in FPC is not an integral part of the consensus mechanism. FPC without random threshold still assures that with reasonable probability, the network will reach a unanimous opinion. However, simulations show that if the nodes use the random threshold, the network is more secure.  It is worth reminding here that there is no requirement for the perfect agreement on the value of the random threshold. It is sufficient for most honest nodes to use the same random threshold to experience the benefits of FPC consensus.  Having that said, we still want the network to utilize more robust FPC security even if the high mana nodes committee fails. To do so, we set up a series of back up the random number generators in the IOTA network (not necessarily decentralized). We plan to use the following sources of random numbers. 





1. **Mana source:** *Committee from high mana nodes*



2. **Community source:** *Pre-selected committee*


3. **Empty source:** *No randomness - random number equals 1/2*





# 5.3.7 Collective beacon 

To recover the random number from beacon messages node needs to perform Lagrange interpolation. Although not very computationally costly, this procedure would need to be completed by each node in the network. 



To avoid that, we propose that committee nodes produce the collective beacon message which contains already computed random number (committee nodes perform Lagrange interpolation on their own). Since the committee size is small and the expected number of TPS for IOTA large, we require all committee members to produce this collective beacon message as soon as they receive $t$ beacon messages.




The cost of getting randomness from collective beacon would be reduced as only the signature verification would be required. 






Non-committee nodes behave as follows: If randomness is required at the time, when no collective beacon is available but more than $t$ beacon messages are published, then the nodes perform Lagrange interpolation themself.
