# Decentralised Random Number Generator for IOTA network - Specification


This specifiaction is part of [Coordicide](https://coordicide.iota.org/).

The module presented in this specification, decentralized random number generator (dRNG), allows for the decentralized generation of randomness used in IOTA network. The dRNG protocol is divided into two parts. In the first part, we provide a committee selection method. The committee is selected from the high mana nodes, however, we do not assume perfect agreement on the mana values (different nodes can have slightly different opinions on the mana values of other nodes). In the second part, the committee members use drand scheme to produce the random number. Drand is based on a combination of verifiable secret sharing scheme and a threshold signature scheme and requires committee members to publish messages with part of the randomness. Those messages are published in the Tangle. In the context of IOTA network, decentralized random numbers are required to FPC consensus mechanism and arrow autopeering (both important for the Coordicide). 





# Introduction


The post-coordinator IOTA network requires a decentralized random number generator (dRNG). Randomness is necessary to increase the security on the FPC. It is also required in the ar-row autopeering protocol and can be used in salt-based autopeering.

In order to provide the dRNG for IOTA network, we decided to use drand scheme, developed by the DEDIS research group (currently under: drand organization). 


The first paragraph from the specification of drand states

> Drand (pronounced ''dee-rand'' is a distributed randomness beacon daemon written in Golang. Servers running drand can be linked with each other to produce collective, publicly verifiable, unbiased, unpredictable random values at fixed intervals using bilinear pairings and threshold cryptography. Drand nodes can also serve locally-generated private randomness to clients.
> 

Full specification of the drand protocol can be found here: https://github.com/drand/drand

Reading further from the specification of drand, its creators claim that drand is

> *  Decentralized: drand is a software ran by a diverse set of reputable entities on the Internet and a threshold of them is needed to generate randomness, there is no central point of failure.
> *  Publicly verifiable & unbiased: drand periodically delivers publicly verifiable and unbiased randomness. Any third party can fetch and verify the authenticity of the randomness and by that making sure it hasn't been tampered with.
> *  And "private" as well: drand nodes can also deliver encrypted randomness to be used in a local applications, for example to seed the OS's PRNG.

Those are the exact properties needed for IOTA dRNG. Another argument in favor of this solution is that it already had been coded, deployed and is currently working providing randomness to the public. Drand organization currently runs a first test network composed by trustworthy organizations around the globe such as Cloudflare, EPFL, University of Chile and Kudelski Security. The main website of the first launch  is hosted at the league of entropy site: https://leagueofentropy.com

The main random number for the IOTA protocol is going to be produced using drand by the committee made from high mana nodes. The high mana nodes proved to be valuable, reliable and trustworthy for the network. Moreover, such nodes have ''the skin in the game'' and it would be in their interest to maintain the security of the network. Such committee members would be updated periodically. Nevertheless, even those reliable nodes can have certain problems like DDOS attacks or connectivity problems. To provide the security of the network even in the case of problems with committee members we equipped our IOTA dRNG proposal with a series of backup options. Backup options are the secondary random number beacons which produce random numbers all the time, however, they are used only if the primary random beacon is not working properly.








## Other options: Threshold vs VDF
Before going directly to the details of the implementation we would like to motivate our choice of a specific method of dRNG. Although the topic of decentralized randomness production is wide and there is a lot of options available, when it comes to well researched and tested proposals there are two ''big players'' in the industry

* VDF based
* Threshold signature-based

An example of the first one is RANDAO which is a smart-contract in the blockchain based DLTs. It is currently being worked on for the Ethereum 2.0. (for more see: [RANDAO specification](https://github.com/randao/randao)). 



Unsurprisingly, the main component of the VDF based dRNG solutions are VDFs (verifiable delay functions). A VDF  is a function which can only be computed sequentially in a certain number of step, and incidentally time $T$, such that anyone can verify it quickly, at most in $O(\log T)$. An important property is that the evaluation cannot be parallelized. To easier fast verification, an evaluator can provide proofs in the output allowing faster verification algorithms while keeping the whole process safe (from [Introduction to VDF for the IOTA](https://app.slack.com/client/T4D3H4VGT/DJPBCMMGT/thread/CHX06PXPW-1586885304.015400)).



VDF can be used to provide a physical time wall on the revealing part of the commit-reveal scheme. Which normally suffers from the last actor problem.

A brief comparison of VDF and threshold signature-based solutions is provided below.


### VDF:
* Physical limits on predicting randomness (best ASICs)
* Single honest actor makes collusion impossible
* Liveness - after contributing randomness nodes can go offline
* Easy to verify on the users part
* Research on ASICs needed
* Requires actor who calculates VDFs
* Not usable for randomness frequency close to the network delay
 * Who contributes randomness?



### Threshold:

* Used in already deployed ``League of Entropy'' 
* Arbitrarily fast
* Easy to verify on the users part
* Open source code available 
* Setup phase required
* Possible collusion
* No calculations outside of the system required (VDF ASIC)
* Who contributes randomness?
        









# Dependencies

The dRNG module depends on the following other modules:

1. Mana (to obtain list of mana)
2. FPC
3. Autopeering








# Outline of the decentralized random number generation


1. Nodes declaring (and proving) their own mana with special ''application'' transaction
2. Selection of $n$ top mana holders to the committee 
3. Key signing phase on the tangle layer
4. Publication of the dRNG messages  in the Tangle

    




# Parameters 





1. Random number production frequency:  $t_{ran}$ 
*Random number is produced every $t_{ran}$ seconds.*


2. Number of participating nodes: $m, m_2$
*The size of the committee from top mana holders equals $m$; the size of the pre-selected committee (responsible for backup random number) equals $m_2$. $m,m_2$ are not necessarily the same as the number of identities that participate in the production of the random number as certain nodes can hold more than one seat in the committee.*


3. Committee sizes:   $n, n_2$
*The number of identities in the committee from top mana holders equals $n$; the number of identities in the pre-selected committee (responsible for backup random number) equals $n_2$.*



4. Drand threshold parameter: $f \in [0,1]$ (percentage), $t \in \mathbb{N}$ (number of nodes)
*In order to produce a random number nodes require more or exactly $t$ secret revealing (beacon) messages ($t =\lceil nf \rceil$).*

 

5. Frequency of committee update:  $Freq.$
*The committee is selected every $Freq.$ units of time.*



6. Time interval of committee ''application'' submission:  $\Delta_A$ 
*Nodes which want to be in the committee have to issue a special ''application'' message in the tangle within time window which lasts $\Delta_A$ units of time.*




7. Time interval of committee communication to obtain distributed key:  $\Delta_C$ 
*The nodes which had been selected to the committee exchange messages to obtain distributed key within $\Delta_C$.*




<!---  6.  Number of nodes submitting ''applications'':  $n^*_{1}, n^*_{2}$

  *$n^*_{1}$ is the number of nodes that issue the ''application'' message within the first $\Delta/2$ units of time.  $n^*_{2}$ is the number of nodes which issue ''application'' message in $\left [\frac{1}{2}\Delta;\frac{3}{4} \Delta\right ]$ units of time if not enough applications had been issued within first $\Delta/2$ units of time.*




8.  The threshold for detecting unusable random number:  $\tau$

*If more than $\tau$ percentage of secret revealing messages include $Rec.=0$ then the random number is considered to be unusable.*



9. The threshold for detecting a failure of the unusable random number for a number of rounds in the row: $\rho$

*If the random number is unusable for $\rho$ random numbers in the row then the new committee selection procedure is started.*

-->


8. Time delay bound of the dRNG messages: $D_{RN}$
The network does not accept the dRNG messages with the timestamp off by more than $D_{RN}$ from node's local time





























# Committee selection



To select the IOTA dRNG committee we acquire the consensus on the mana values of the high mana holders (remember that there is no perfect consensus on the mana values and different nodes can have slightly different values of mana). We require all of the nodes interested in the committee participation to prepare a special ''application'' transaction which determines the value of mana of a given node. Then the committee is formed from top $n$ highest mana holders.


## Fixing mana perception



To obtain the consensus on the mana value of the top nodes we require them to submit special application messages to the tangle with information about their mana.
 


Assume that the committee should be formed at the time $t_0$. Remember that $D_{RN}$ is bound of accepting dRNG messages in the tangle. Then no honest node will accept dRNG message with the timestamp different by more than $D_{RN}$ from its local time. 
Lets denote 
$$
T_0 = t_0 - \Delta_C - D_{RN}.
$$
Then we require the potential committee members to issue an application message in the Tangle with a timestamp  from an interval 
$$
[T_0 -\Delta_A, T_0].
$$
We can be sure that after the time $t_0 - \Delta_C$ no application message will be accepted in the Tangle. 

> [name=Sebastian Mueller] "We can be sure.." this formulation is not correct. Moreover the protocol needs a rule how to treat the event when it occurs. Also the formulation in 8. above is too strong, since local clocks differ and we need consensus on local times to have this.

Such transaction would be used to extract *only* a mana value of an issuing node i.e.: manas of two potential committee members are going to be deduced from different transactions. 



In order to deduce mana value from the transaction, we calculate mana using only the transactions with a timestamp smaller or equal to the timestamp if the application transaction.



This method of committee selection has an advantage that only online nodes can apply to be a committee member. Also, if a certain node predicts that it will not be able to be a committee member for the entire period (for example due to the planned maintenance) it can decide not to apply. 


If a node sends more than one application message they are treated as conflicts. Such behavior can be later punished (this action is not relevant for dRNG protocol).
> [name=Sebastian Mueller] Or, if there are more than two applications messages, all applications are dropped and the node is not considered for the committee. In case of conflicts, we would have to vote.

 
### Time of applications and who should apply?


In general, any node can issue an application message and such a message would be accepted by the tangle (assuming it passes rate control). However,  we admit that for a low mana node such behavior does not make much sense. We provide a default application algorithm that tells node when to apply. 





A node is said to be $M_\ell$ if according to its own view of mana it is among top $\ell$ mana nodes. 



Then nodes produce application messages according to the following: 


If a node $x$ is $M_{2m}$ then it issues an application transaction with a timestamp $T-\Delta_A$.


If  for a $k >2$ a node $x$ is $M_{m\cdot k}$ but not $M_{m\cdot (k-1)}$ ($m$ is committee size) then it submits a committee application if before the time $T- \Delta_A \frac{\ell-2}{\ell-1}$ there is less than $m$ valid application messages with mana greater then mana of $x$. Node $x$ issues application message with a timestamp $T- \Delta_A \frac{\ell-2}{\ell-1}$.

> [name=Sebastian Mueller] For small nodes, it may be useful to have a flag indicating that a node does not participate at all. In this case this node does not have to "listen" to all of this committee selection thing.

<!--
A node $x$ has a (subjective) list of mana of all of the nodes. After ordering it, the node knows what is its position on this list. Let's name denote this position by $x_m$.



We divide all of the nodes into three groups:

*a)* $x_m \geq n^*_1$ 

*b)* $n^*_1> x_m \geq n^*_2$

*c)* $n^*_{2} >x_m$ 



Dependent on what group node is in node takes different actions. 
Group *a)* produces application message within time interval $[ t_0 - 2D_{RN} -\Delta; t_0 - 2D_{RN}-\Delta/2]$.


Group *b)* checks wheather at time $t_0 - 2D_{RN}-\Delta/2$ (according to its local clock) the number of committee applications which state that node's mana is higher than $x_m$ is larger than $n$. If yes then node do nothing. If no it publishes application with a timestamp from an interval $\left [ t_0 - 2D_{RN} -\Delta/2; t_0 - 2D_{RN}-\frac{3}{4}\Delta \right ]$.
 

Group *c)* checks wheather at time $t_0 - 2D_{RN}-\frac{3}{4}\Delta$ (according to its local clock) number of committee applications which state that node's mana is higher than of $x_m$ is greater than $n$. If yes then node do nothing. If no it publishes application with a timestamp from an interval $\left [ t_0 - 2D_{RN} -\frac{3}{4}\Delta; t_0 - 2D_{RN}-\Delta \right ]$.



So, in other words, top $n^*_1$ nodes issue application transaction within $\Delta/2$ time window. After that, if not enough applications had been submitted another $n^*_2$ are issued by the time $\frac{3}{4}\Delta$. If after that still not enough messages had been issued every active node tries to issue an application. 

-->

## Getting committee from mana perception

When enough applications are in the tangle and there is a consensus on the mana of top holders, we select  $n$ top mana holders to be in the committee. This approach is straightforward and seems to decrease the probability of malicious node getting into the committee (higher mana is required to be in the committee).




## Message exchange phase - DKG

At the time $t_0 - \Delta_C$ the Tangle does not accept application messages with the timestamps from the application interval. Thus there is an objective criterion for nodes that apply for the committee and we can select one (pick the top $m$ nodes). 

Just after that, the message exchange phase begins were newly selected committee members are creating the distributed key. This phase lasts up to $\Delta_C$ and all of the messages are exchanged publically in the Tangle.

If successful, then before $t_0$ distributed key should be generated and the first random number should be produced at $t_0$. 

Assume that a certain node applied to be in a committee and got a seat. If this node refuses to create a distributed key by not exchanging messages, then the committee fails. In the case of committee selection, failure procedure is repeated at time $t_1,t_2,...$ (described below) and the node which did not place the messages in the tangle is refused to participate in the next committee selection. This is done by modification of its (committee) mana to 0 until next committee is *successfully* selected. Note that we are talking here only about committee mana, mana used for other purposes is unchanged.

> [name=Sebastian Mueller] But for this to work we would need consensus on who refused/was not able to participate. Say if adversary just sends its distributed key with correct timestamps, such that half of the network sees it in time but the other half too late. This consensus may be done by the message layer in case $D_{RN}$ equals the $D$(?) there, otherwise, a FPC must be done. 




## Committee selection failure 


If at time $t_0$ there will be no randomness produced (which can be confirmed only at the time $t_0+D_{RN}$) then another attempt of selecting committee takes place. This time the committee selection time is $t_1 =t_0 +2D_{RN}+\Delta_A+\Delta_C$ and window for application messages is still $\Delta_A$. Nodes produce application messages according to the same rules as for $t_0$. This can be generalised for $k$-th attempt to select the committee at the time $t_k = t_0 + D_{RN}+ k(D_{RN} + \Delta_A+\Delta_C)$. 



## Double seats in the committee 
Note that in the original drand protocol all of the seats in the committee are equivalent and no node is more important than the others. 



Our research revealed that if we follow the same method of assigning seats in the mana committee then our proposed protocol might be vulnerable for "overtaking" the committee. An attacker could gain more than $t$ seats in the committee with relatively small mana (about 6% for $n=15$). To reduce this attack vector we decided to grant double seats for half of the committee with the highest mana (we assume that highest mana nodes are honest). Those nodes would receive two private keys (identities) with which they sign beacon messages in the Tangle. From the technical point of view, two seats are completely separate and issued messages can not be combined (even though physically signed by the same node). This increases mana required to "overtake" the committee. The total number of nodes with double seats equals $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ which makes the total number of identities in the committee equal 

$$
n + \lfloor n/2 \rfloor = \left \lfloor 1\frac{1}{2}n \right \rfloor.
$$


## Synching of committee nodes

Before starting random number generations committee nodes should synch up theirs clocks, with each other or some other central entitiy like atomic clock services.



# Backup options
Although unlikely it is still possible that the mana committee fails to produce a random number. It can happen when the network is under attack or committee nodes are dealing with technical problems. Even reliable committee members can have certain problems like DDOS attacks. They can be hacked or compromised in other unexpected ways. Although drand has built-in certain countermeasures for those cases - one needs only $t$ out of $n$ signatures (not all of the committee members are required to publish a secret-revealing message).  We want to make sure that the benefits that come from a random number (which include increased security) are going to be available even if a large number of committee members are compromised.


As we already pointed out the random number used in FPC is not an inseparable part of the consensus mechanism. FPC without random threshold still assures that with reasonable probability the network will reach a unanimous opinion. However, as simulations show if the nodes in the network use the random threshold then the network is more secure - the smaller probability of fork.  What is worth reminding here is that there is no requirement for the perfect agreement on the value of the random threshold. It is sufficient for the majority of the honest nodes to use the same random threshold to use the full benefits of FPC consensus.  Having that said we still want the network to utilize stronger security of FPC even if the high mana nodes committee fails. To do so we set up a series of back up the random number generators in the IOTA network (not necessarily decentralized). We order them according to the measure of decentralization from the most decentralized to the most centralized. The rule is that if a node has available multiple random numbers it always picks the highest quality random number. We divide our backup random number beacons into the ''sources''.



We have the following sources of random numbers 





1. **Mana source:** *Committee from high mana nodes*



2. **Community source:** *Pre-selected committee*

3. **IF source:** *IOTA Foundation (''coordinator'') random number*

4. **Empty source:** *No randomness - random number equals 1/2*





The first and second sources are the committee based. In both cases, the committee uses drand to produce random numbers, the secret-revealing messages are published in the Tangle. The second source committee is going to be pre-selected and hardcoded into the client. The committee members are going to be selected by IOTA Foundation. The second instance committee members can be: *a)* IOTA Foundation business partners, *b)* Active committee members. Or a combination of both. 



The third instance random number is going to be produced by the specialized IOTA Foundation owned node which publishes pseudo-random numbers in the Tangle.



If all of the previous options fail, nodes that want to perform FPC voting should use $\beta = 1/2$ in theirs FPC voting (a random number equal to 1/2). 


Let us stress that in the case if a certain small group of honest nodes use the  lower quality source of randomness then still the FPC consensus can experience benefits of random threshold.



# Collective beacon 

To recover the random number from beacon messages node needs to perform Lagrange interpolation. This procedure although not very computationally costly would need to be performed by each node in the network. 



To avoid that, we propose that committee nodes produce the collective beacon message which contains already computed random number (committee nodes perform Lagrange interpolation on their own). Since the committee size is small and the expected number of TPS for post coordicade IOTA is in orders of thousands we require all of the committee members to produce this collective beacon message. 







The cost of getting randomness from collective beacon would be reduced as only the signature verification would be required. 







If at the time when randomness is required there is no collective beacon in the Tangle but there are enough beacon messages then the nodes perform Lagrange interpolation themselves.

# Committee failure and RN recoverability



We designed our dRNG messages in such a way that the secret-revealing, beacon messages contain an additional bit of information called `Rec.` (recoverability). The value of this bit is `0` if in the last round given nodes was able to recover the RN from the messages issued by other committee members i.e.: whether the node received at least `t` beacon messages in time (Value of `Rec.` can be also set to zero based on other premises. For example when the node knows that some of the committee members were compromised.


If the committee failed and stopped producing RN then all of the other nodes in the network use lower instance RN, while the committee takes appropriate actions. Active and honest committee members drop out of the current committee and apply for the membership in the new one. 





Committee member deduces that in the last round the committee failed to produce random number if more than `tau` fraction of the beacon messages contain `Rec. = 0`. The trigger for dropping out of the committee is a situation in which node deduces that the RN was not produced for `rho` rounds in a row. Note that in the environment of the committee failure, when nodes receive less than `tau` fraction of the messages it is not feasible to run any consensus mechanism (like pBFT) as all of them can withstand up to the `1/3` of faulty nodes.
