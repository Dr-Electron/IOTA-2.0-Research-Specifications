# 6.5 Decentralised Random Number Generator
  
  
  
The module presented in this specification allows for the decentralized generation of randomness for the IOTA 2.0 network. The dRNG protocol is divided into three phases. In the first phase, a committee of high mana nodes is selected.  In the second setup phase, the committee members create a collective private key used in the third, beacon phase, where the random numbers are published in the Tangle.  
  
During the committee selection, we do not assume a perfect agreement on the mana values, i.e., different nodes can have slightly different opinions on the mana values of other nodes. Obtaining the consensus on the mana values is the central part of this documentation. In the setup phase, a pair of collective private and public keys are created in such a way that no individual committee member knows the entire private key. This is done using $(t,n)$ Distributed Key Generation (DKG), which does not rely on centralized, trusted third parties. In the beacon phase, messages containing random numbers can be signed with the private collective key when at least $t$ of the $n$ committee nodes sign a message with their private key share. All of the random number messages used in three phases are published in the Tangle.  
 
 A large part of the procedures in this specification is based on the article:
 
https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03139
 
Where authors discuss multiple methods of the committee selection and applications.
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
# 6.5.1 Dependencies  
  
  
1. Mana  
    Mana is necessary in dRNG. We use it to find the most trustworthy nodes in the network. Later those nodes and form a committee that produces the random numbers. 
  
2. FPC  
    Random numbers produced by dRNG are used in FPC voting.
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
# 6.5.2 Outline 
 
The random number generation procedure is divided into three phases. 
 
**1. COMMITTEE SELECTION:**  
In this phase, the network finds the most trustworthy nodes in the network. The trust level is determined with mana, which measures how much of a “skin in the game” nodes have. The procedure is objective i.e., all of the nodes in the network reach a consensus on what nodes should be in the committee.  
  
In order for a node to be in the committee which produces random numbers, it needs to declare its willingness to participate, with a special ''application'' message. When all of the application messages are recorded in the Tangle, $n$ top mana holders are selected to be on the committee.   
  
  
**2. DKG PHASE:**  
  
Distributed key generation phase. Takes place on the Tangle. The participation of committee nodes can be publicly verified. It is required to establish a collective key used to generate randomness.   
  
**3. PUBLICATION PHASE:**  
  
Publication of the beacon messages in the Tangle. In this phase committee nodes periodically publish randomness in the Tangle. Other nodes can read the random number directly from the Tangle public ledger.

# 6.5.4  Committee selection  
   
  
  
To select the committee based on the consensus mana, we need a consensus on the consensus mana values. Unfortunately, different nodes have different views on mana. It is due to the slightly different clocks and downloaded transactions.  Note: in this specification we use only consensus mana and from now on skip the word "consensus".
  
The Tangle graph in IOTA 2.0 lacks an obvious 'reference point,' which could be used to calculate mana values. Note that this is not a problem in blockchains where such a reference point could be every $k$-th block. Neither it is a problem in IOTA 1.0 where milestones could be such a reference. To solve this problem, we use the timestamps of the transactions. Our reference point becomes a specific time (from the transaction, not based on the local clocks).  This point in time determines the mana values of the potential committee members who want to be on the committee. An announcement of the willingness to participate in the committee is announced with a special application message. Application messages like any other transactions in the tangle are equipped with timestamps. The Tangle rejects the transactions with timestamps that are too off, therefore application transactions with proper timestamps can not be added to the Tangle too long after that time. Thus application messages can reliably give us a list of nodes interested in joining the committee. After this process is finished the committee is formed from the $n$ highest mana holders.  
 
  
## 6.5.4.1 Application messages  
  
  Application messages have to be submitted within a special time window of length $\Delta_A$ units of time (we discuss this time interval below).  
  
Any node can issue an application message. Such a message would be accepted by the Tangle (assuming it passes the rate control). However, we admit that for a low mana node, such behavior does not make much sense as the probability of being selected is very low. Low mana nodes can decide not to take part in sending application messages. Multiple application messages are allowed. However, they are pointless and, in fact, costly as they have to pass the rate control mechanism.  
  
Assume that the committee should be formed at the time $t_0$. Time $t_0$ is determined by the parameters of the protocol (committee is updated periodically, frequency is determined in the protocol level). Remember that $D$ is bound on accepting messages with the wrong timestamp i.e. if a message is issued at the time $t_{send}$ (with respect to the node’s $X$ local clock) and the timestamp is greater than $t_{send}+D$ or smaller than $t_{send}-D$ then $X$ can be certain that such transaction will be definitely rejected (without voting on the timestamp). No honest node accepts an application message with a timestamp different by more than $D$ from its local time.  Therefore, if the last moment when the application message can be sent is $t_{last}$, then every node can be sure that message with such timestamp will not be issued after the time $t_{last}+D$ (with respect to the node’s local clock). 
 
Let us denote  
  
$$  
T_0 = t_0 - D.  
$$  
  
Then we require the potential committee members to issue an application message in the Tangle with a timestamp from the interval 
  
$$
[T_0 -\Delta_A, T_0].
$$
                    
  
The mana value of all nodes would be calculated for the time $T_0$ (reference point). Regardless of the timestamp of the application message.  
  
For nodes interested in committee participation, we provide a default application algorithm that tells nodes when to apply. Nodes can modify it, however, we encourage them to stick with it as it reduces the number of exchanged application messages.  
  
  ### 6.5.4.1.1 Application message sending - default algorithm 
 
A node is said to be $M_\ell$ if it is among top $\ell$ top mana nodes (with respect to the time $T_0 -\Delta_A$).  
  
 If a node $x$ is $M_{2m}$ then it issues an application at the time $T_0-\Delta_A$.  
  
  
for a $k >2$ a node $x$ is $M_{m\times k}$ but not $M_{m\times (k-1)}$ ($m$ is committee size) then it submits a committee application if before the time $T_0- \Delta_A \frac{\ell-2}{\ell-1}$ there is less than $m$ valid application messages with mana greater than $x$.  
  
  
  
Pseudocode:  
```  
if (this_node_wants_to_participate_in_dRNG) then  
    if (time == T_0-Delta_A)  
        ell = what_is_my_ell_number(my_ID,MANA_vector)  
        CALL APPLICATION_MESSAGE_SEND(ell)  
    fi  
fi  
```  
  
```  
subroutine APPLICATION_MESSAGE_SEND(ell)  
if (ell <= 2) then  
    timestamp = T_0-Delta_A  
    send_application_message(timestamp)  
else  
    wait_untill(T- Delta_A *(ell-2)/(ell-1))  
    if (number_of_valid_application_messages_with_mana_higher_than_mine < m) then  
        send_application_message(timestamp)  
    fi  
fi  
endsubroutine  
```  
  
  
  
If $m$ or more nodes sent an application message within the time interval, the committee is formed from the top $m$ mana nodes who applied. Due to the network delay, this can be confirmed only at the time $t_0$.  
  
If committee selection was a failure, then the procedure should be repeated. In general, if the failed committee selection was supposed to be done at the time $t_n$ then the procedure is repeated. A new  new expected time of committee selection is  $t_n + \Delta_A +D$. 
  
  
  
# 6.5.5 DKG phase  
  
After successful committee selection, confirmed at the time $t_0$ (with respect to node's local clock), the DKG phase starts. In this phase, committee nodes exchange the *Deal messages* to produce a public/private collective key. Nodes should proceed with DKG message exchange as soon as committee selection is confirmed (time $t_0$).  
  
 If any committee node refuses to create a collective key pair by not exchanging Deal DKG messages, the DKG phase fails. This can be confirmed at the time $t_0 + D$ (using the node's local clock). Moreover, since the message exchange occurs on the Tangle, everybody can identify nodes that caused the failure. In DKG phase failure, the entire committee selection is repeated. The malicious node can then be excluded from the new committee on the process by modifying mana to zero. This modification is applied only to the mana used in dRNG module. Mana values used for other purposes are unchanged. Moreover, modification is lifted after the committee is *successfully* selected, i.e., the committee produces its first beacon messages.  
  
  
If DKG phase failure is confirmed a the time $t_n + D$, then the committee selection is repeated with a new expected time of committee selection $t_{n+1} = t_n +2\times D+\Delta_A$.  
 
We can increase the security of dRNG beacon by granting double seats for half of the highest mana. Those nodes would receive two private keys (identities) with which they sign beacon messages in the Tangle. From the technical point of view, two seats are completely separate, and issued messages can not be combined (even though physically signed by the same node). This modification increases mana required to "overtake" the committee, which is understood as gaining $t$ of seats in the committee. Without it, an attacker could gain more than $t$ seats in the committee with about 12% mana for $m=15$. With double seat proposal, minimal mana to overtake doubles.  
  
  
The total number of nodes with double seats equals $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ which makes the total number of identities in the committee equal  
  
$$  
n + \lfloor n/2 \rfloor = \left \lfloor 1\frac{1}{2}n \right \rfloor.  
$$  
  
  
  
  
 
# 6.5.6 Publication of the randomness 
 
Committee nodes generate randomness by producing beacon messages. Each node produces its own beacon messages. A single beacon message does not allow to know the random number. Only when $t$ or more beacon messages are published the next random number is revealed. 
 
## 6.5.6.1 Collective beacon message  
  
To recover the random number from the beacon messages node needs to perform Lagrange interpolation. This procedure is needed to be completed by each node in the network.   
    
To avoid that, we propose that the committee nodes produce the collective beacon message which contains already computed random numbers (committee nodes perform Lagrange interpolation on their own). Since the committee size is small and the expected number of TPS for IOTA large, we require all committee members to produce this collective beacon message as soon as they receive $t$ beacon messages. 
  
    
The cost of getting randomness from the collective beacon would be reduced as only the signature verification would be required.  
  
  
Non-committee nodes behave as follows: If randomness is required at the time when no collective beacon is available but more than $t$ beacon messages are published, then the nodes perform Lagrange interpolation themselves.  
  
  
 
  
# 6.5.7 Duties of the old committee  
  
The old committee should stop producing randomness only if the new committee was successfully selected and started producing random numbers. This is confirmed when $t$ or more beacon messages are produced by the new committee and can be read directly from the Tangle.  
  
  
  
# 6.5.8 Community dRNG  
  
Although unlikely, it is still possible that the mana committee fails to produce a random number. To increase the liveness of the random number production in the IOTA 2.0, we will deploy multiple dRNGs. The first alternative (deployed with the coordicide) is the committee dRNG. It uses the same cryptographical $(t,n)$-scheme, but the committee is pre-selected from community members. Details of the random number usage from different sources in FPC are described in specification FPC (LINK???)  
  
In the future, we also want to deploy a backup randomness beacon based on verifiable delay functions (VDF).
