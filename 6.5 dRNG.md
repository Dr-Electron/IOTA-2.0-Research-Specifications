# 6.5 Decentralized Random Number Generator

The module presented in this specification allows for the decentralized generation of randomness for the post-coordicide IOTA network. The dRNG protocol is divided into three phases:

1. COMMITTEE SELECTION: In the first phase, a committee of high consensus mana nodes is selected. The procedure is objective i.e., all of the nodes in the network reach consensus on which nodes should be in the committee.
In order for a node to be considered as a candidate to the committee, it needs to declare its willingness to participate, with a special _application message_. When all of the required application messages are recorded in the Tangle, the `CommitteeNodes` top mana holders among the candidates are selected as the committee. In the case where some of the required messages fail to be produced, the committee selection will consequently fail as well.

2. DKG PHASE: In the second setup phase, the committee members create a collective private key which will be used later to generate the random number, using the $(t,n)$ Distributed Key Generation (DKG), that does not rely on centralized, trusted third parties. The participation of the nodes in this phase can be publicly verified, since he message exchange here is made in the Tangle. 

3. PUBLICATION PHASE: This last phase consists on the periodical publication of the beacon messages in the Tangle. A single individual beacon message should not be sufficient to reveal the random number; instead, the beacon messages from at least $t$ out of $n$ committee members are needed for the next random number being revealed. Additionally, the committee members may publish a collective beacon message, which would contain the (already computed) random number. 

A large part of the procedures in this specification is based on the article:
 
https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03139
 
Where authors discuss multiple methods of the committee selection and applications.

 
 
 
  
  
  
  
# 6.5.1 Dependencies  
 

The dRNG module depends on the **Mana module**, since it uses the Consensus Mana vector as a measure of trustworthiness. Specifically, it uses the list of the top Mana holders to select a committee to produce the random numbers. During the committee selection, we do not assume a perfect agreement on the mana values, i.e., different nodes can have slightly different perceptions of the mana values of other nodes. Obtaining consensus on the mana values is the central part of this documentation. 

The random numbers produced by dRNG are used in the **FPC module**.

# 6.5.2 Parameters  

1. The random number production perioid: `RNperioid`  
    *Random number is produced every`RNperioid` seconds.*  
    **Suggested value**: `RNPerioid`= 20 [sec]. 

2. Number of nodes in the committee: `CommitteeNodes`.  
    **Suggested value**: `CommitteeNodes`=10 [nodes].   
  
3. Committee seat sizes: `CommitteeSeats`  
      *The number of identities (seats) in the top mana holders committee equals `CommitteeSeats`. It is different form  `CommitteeNodes` because some of the nodes receive double seats in the committee.*  
    **Suggested value**: `CommitteeSeats`=15   [seats]$.  
  
4. Signature threshold parameter:`SigThreshold` (number of beacon messages needed to obtain randomness)  
    **Suggested value**:`SigThreshold`=8 [messages] ([seats]).    
  
5. Perioid of committee update: `CommUpdate`.  
    **Suggested value**: `CommUpdate` = 1 [day].    
  
6. Time window of the ''application'' message submission: `ApplicationWindow`  
    **Suggested value**: `ApplicationWindow`=2 [min].  
  
7. Time delay bound on the dRNG messages: $D$    
    *The network does not accept the dRNG messages with the timestamp off by more than $D$ from the node's local time. This parameter is defined in the (OBJECT OF CONSENSUS???) specification. (SAY SOMETHING ABOUT LOK)*  
    **Suggested value**: $D = ??? [min]$ (TO BE DETERMINED LATER ) 
  

 
 
 
 
  
# 6.5.3  Committee selection  

To select the committee based on the consensus mana, we need to achieve consensus on these values. Unfortunately, due to the small differences in clocks and ledger states, nodes may have different views on mana. To solve this problem, we must introduce a reference point that can be used to calculate the consensus mana values in an objective manner. 
  
The Tangle graph after coordicide lacks a natural reference point to calculate mana values. Notice that this reference point is quite straightforward to define in blockchain based ledgers (every multiple of $k$ block height, for instance). We introduce then a reference point using timestamps of the transactions, which are objective and consequently not subject to local clocks discrepancies.

The willingness to participate in the committee is announced with a special application message, which like any other transactions in the Tangle are equipped with timestamps. Since the nodes following the protocol judge and invalidate messages which timestamps are too off, we can assume that the application messages can reliably give us a list of nodes interested in joining the committee. 
 
## 6.5.3.1 Application messages  
  
Any node can issue an application message. Such a message would be processed by the nodes (assuming it passes the congestion control, along with other checks). However, for a low mana node, there is no incentive to apply for the committee, as the probability of being selected is very low; hence, they can decide to not take part in sending application messages. Although it is allowed, sending multiple application messages is pointless and costly due to the congestion control mechanism.  
  
Assume that a committee should be formed at the time $t_F$ (which is known to all interested nodes; it is defined on the protocol level). Assume further that the time $t_F$ is in the epoch $E$ i.e., $t_F$ $\in$ $[t_{E-1}$,$t_E]$. Then the Mana of all of the nodes is calculated with respect to the active Mana vector from a time $t_{E-2}$ which is a Mana ballance from two epoches before $t_F$. The committee selection process starts with the opening of the application message window at the time $t_S$, where $t_S$ = $t_F$-`ApplicationWindow` -2$X$. For as long as the application window is open, nodescan issue application messages. See the subsection "6.5.3.1.1 Application message sending - default algorithm" for the proposed algorithm of putting application messages (which is not enforceable). 

### 6.5.3.1.1 Application message sending - default algorithm 
 
A node is said to be $M_\ell$ if its Mana rank is less or equal to $\ell$ (node is among $\ell$ top mana nodes).  
  
If an interested node $x$ is $M_{2m}$ (where $m$ is the committee size) then it issues an application at the time $T_0-\Delta_A$. Notice that, in general, not all of the $2m$ application messages will be sent. If less than $m$ valid application messages are sent at $T_0-\Delta_A$, the nodes that are $M_{3m}$ (but not $M_{2m}$) shall issue their application messages at $T_0- \Delta_A \frac{1}{2}$ and so on. In general, for $k>2$, if a node $x$ is $M_{m k}$ but not $M_{m (k-1)}$, it will submit a committee application whenever before the time $T_0- \Delta_A \frac{k-2}{k-1}$ there are less than $m$ valid application messages with c-Mana greater than the c-Mana of node $x$.  

Pseudocode:  
```  
IF (this_node_wants_to_participate_in_dRNG)
   Wait_Untill(time == t_S) then  
        ell = what_is_my_mana_rank(my_ID,MANA_vector)  
        CALL APPLICATION_MESSAGE_SEND(ell)  
```  
  
```  
subroutine APPLICATION_MESSAGE_SEND(ell)  
IF (ell <= 2m) then  
    send_application_message  
else  
    wait_until(T_S- ApplicationWindow *[1-(floor(ell/m)-2)/(floor(ell/m)-1)])  
    IF (number_of_valid_application_messages_with_mana_higher_than_mine < m) then  
        send_application_message(T_0- Delta_A *[1-(floor(ell/m)-2)/(floor(ell/m)-1))  
endsubroutine  
```   



If at least $m$ of the nodes sent an application message within the time interval, the committee is formed from the top $m$ mana nodes who applied. Due to the network delay, this can be confirmed only at the time $t_0$.  
  
If less than $m$ nodes send application messages, then the committee selection will fail. In this case, the procedure should be repeated after a new time window of $\Delta_A$; i.e., if the failed committee selection looked for application messages in the interval $[T_n -\Delta_A, T_n]$, then the procedure is repeated scanning the interval $[T_n, T_n+\Delta_A]$.

# 6.5.4 DKG phase  
  
After a successful committee selection, confirmed at the time $t_S+X$+`ApplicationWindow` with respect to node's local clock, the DKG phase starts. In this phase, the committee nodes exchange the *Deal messages* to produce a public/private collective key. There is no time window for DKG phase and nodes should proceed with the corresponding  DKG message exchange as soon as the committee selection is confirmed (time $t_S+X$+`ApplicationWindow`).

If any committee node refuses to create a collective key pair by not exchanging Deal DKG messages, the DKG phase fails. This can be confirmed at the time $t_F= $t_S+2X$+`ApplicationWindow`. Moreover, since the message exchange occurs on the Tangle, everybody can identify nodes that caused the failure. In DKG phase failure, the entire committee selection is repeated. The malicious node is then excluded from the new committee selection i.e., all application messages issued by a malicious node are ignored. Ban on the committee application is lifted after a successful committee selection i.e., the committee produces its first beacon messages. In other words if a node failed to produce a DKG message (either due to malfunction or maliciousness) it can not apply to be in the current committee, however, it can apply in the next committee selection. 
  
  
Is_application_message(tx) -function returns `TRUE` if `tx` is application message and false otherwise
Is_blacklisted(node) - function returns `TRUE` if `node` is blacklisted from dRNG committee selection
Issuing_node(tx) - returns id of a node that issued `tx`
```
IF (NOT Is_blacklisted(Issuing_node(tx)))
   IF (Mana(Issuing_node(tx),E-2) > Mana(My_node,E-2))
      number_of_valid_application_messages_with_mana_higher_than_mine ++ 

```  
  
  
  
If DKG phase failure is confirmed a the time $t_F$, then the committee selection is repeated with a new expected time of committee selection $t_F' = t_F + 2X$+ `ApplicationWindow`.
 
 # 6.5.5 Double seats  
  
We can increase the security of dRNG beacon by granting double seats to the half of the committee members that have the highest Mana. Those nodes would receive two private keys (identities) with which they sign beacon messages in the Tangle. From the technical point of view, two seats are completely separate, and issued messages can not be combined (even though they were signed by the same node). This modification increases the amount of mana required to "overtake" the committee, which is understood as gaining $t$ of seats in the committee. Without it, an attacker could gain more than $t$ seats in the committee with about 12% mana for 15 nodes in the committee. Using the double seat proposal, the minimal mana required to overtake the commitee doubles.  
  
The total number of nodes with double seats equals $\lfloor m/2 \rfloor$ which makes the total number of identities in the committee equal $m + \lfloor m/2 \rfloor$.
 
# 6.5.6 Publication of the random number 
 
The committee will collectively generate a random number based on the set of beacon messages that each node will individually produce. A single beacon message should not be sufficient to reveal the random number; instead, $t$ or more beacon messages are needed for the next random number being revealed. 

## 6.5.6.1 Collective beacon message  
  
To recover the random number from the individual beacon messages, all nodes in the network would need to perform Lagrange interpolation. To avoid that, we propose that the committee nodes produce a _collective beacon message_, which contains pre-computed random numbers (meaning that the committee nodes will perform the Lagrange interpolation on their own). Since the committee size is small and the expected throughput of the network is large, we require all committee members to produce this collective beacon message as soon as they receive $t$ individual beacon messages. 
  
The cost of getting randomness from the collective beacon would be reduced as only (additionally to the default message checks) the signature verification would be required.  
  

# 6.5.7 Duties of the old committee  
  
An old committee should only stop producing randomness if another committee was successfully selected and started producing random numbers, which will be confirmed when the collective beacon message is produced by the new committee and can be read directly from the Tangle.  

# 6.5.8 Alternative dRNG and backup options  
  
To increase the liveness of the random number production in the post-coordicide IOTA, we will deploy multiple dRNGs. The first alternative (deployed with the coordicide) is the committee dRNG. It uses the same cryptographic $(t,n)$-scheme, but the committee is pre-selected from community members. Details of the random number usage from different sources in FPC are described in specification FPC (LINK???)
