# 2.3 Bootstrapping

  
The module presented in this specification, bootstrapping, allows a new node to join the network. This process is the first action undertaken by the node and includes: finding other nodes in the network; obtaining the ledger; obtaining information needed to find neighbors; and identify the dRNG committee. To do so the new nodes rely on the entry nodes.
  

The bootstrapping process has the following phases:

  
  

1. Entry information gathering

  

2. Neighbor selection

  

3. Ledger

  

4. In-synch assessment

  

  

**PARAMETERS** (WIP; to discuss):

  

$n_{EN}$ = 9 [nodes]  new node in the network connects to $n_{EN}$ = 9 entry nodes

  

$min_{EN}$ = 6 [nodes]  minimal number of responses from entry nodes

  

$t_{EN}$ = 30 [sec] (??)  waiting time for the response from the entry nodes

  

$t_{ledg}$ = 90 [sec] (??) waiting time from the response from the provider of the ledger

t_{ledg-spam} = 300 [sec]

  
  

# 2.3.1 Phase 1: Entry information gathering

  

Entry information gathering is done via entry nodes. Entry nodes do not have to be normal Tangle nodes. However, they have to have an access to the following information from the Tangle:

  

1. List of peers in the network (LoP)

  

2. Salt hash-chains

  

3. Mana values (MV)

  

4. dRNG committee selection data (dRNG data)

  
  

Entry nodes should be run by both IF and community.

  

Information 1-4 about the network should be gathered from multiple entry nodes. This prevents putting too much trust in one entity. A new node $X$ tries to get entry information from $n_{EN}$ entry nodes (chosen randomly). $X$ assumes that its request was unanswered if the answer did not come within $t_{EN}$ seconds. If the node $X$ received less than $min_{EN}$ responses it repeats the procedure with different entry nodes.

   

## 2.3.1.1 List of peers

  
  
For the simplicity, we assume that a valid ID of a peer in the network is a pair of ID + last value of the salt hash chain i.e., two LoP from different entry nodes which contain the same ID of a node $Y$ but different salt from the hash chain are treated as different. $X$ should receive mostly the same LoP, however, they may differ in few entries. The final list of peers used by X contains only the nodes which appear in the $min_{EN}$ majority of the LoP i.e., a node $Y$ is in the $X$’s list of online peers if it appeared in more than $min_{EN}$ of the LoP sent to $X$.
  

## 2.3.1.2 Mana Values

  

To obtain an MV of a peer $Y$ node $X$ averages all of the mana values for $Y$ obtained from the entry nodes. For example, if $X$ sends 7 requests to entry nodes; 5 entry nodes respond and LoP of 4 of them contain $Y$ with mana values $MV^1_Y,MV^2_Y,MV^3_Y,MV^4_Y$ then the mana value of a node $Y$ equals $(MV^1_Y+MV^2_Y+MV^3_Y+MV^4_Y)/4$.

  
  

## 2.3.1.2 dRNG data

  

DRNG data contains:

  

1. Collective public key

  

2. IDs of all committee nodes

  

3. Public keys of drng members

  

4. dRNG round number

  

If more than $min_{EN}$ entry nodes send $X$ the same dRNG data then $X$ assumes that the committee is working and can be identified from the information. Otherwise, $X$ assumes that there is no currently working dRNG committee in the Tangle.

  

# 2.3.2 Phase 2: Neighbor selection

  
  

After phase 1, node $X$ has:

  

1. List of online peers

  

2. Mana values

  

3. Autopeering salts

  

Which, is all of the information it needs to find neighbors. For the details see [Section 3.4 - Neighbor Selection](./3.4%20Neighbor%20Selection.md).

  
  

# 2.3.3 Phase 3: Ledger

  
  
This phase (6.1.3 Phase 3: Ledger) can take place at the same time as the "Phase 2: Neighbor selection". 

To obtain a ledger a node $X$ asks a single node $Y$ from LoP to send it entire ledger (snapshot + recent transactions). The node $Y$ is selected randomly with the probability weighted by mana from the top half mana holders. Node $X$ waits for the response from $Y$ for $t_{ledg}$ seconds. If the response is negative (node $Y$ will not send a ledger) or did not come within $t_{ledg}$ the node $X$ tries to select another node and asks it for a snapshot.

Assume $X$ sends $Y$ a request for the ledger. A node $Y$ sends a ledger if **the network is not congested (what does it mean?)** **$Y$ was not asked for the ledger within last NN seconds?** 

First, a new node creates a hash chain of length 10,000. The last element of this hash chain is their initial salt. Nodes declare their initial salt in a message on the tangle using a payload type called `salt declaration`. In a salt declaration message, the declaring node includes

+ The declaring node ID (which can be different from the node ID issuing the message)
+ The initial salt
+ The timestamp (which should be close to the timestamp of its containing message)
+ Node signature

### Salt chain

The salt declaration messages must be signed so that all “redeclerations” would be malicious.
The declaring node can prepare the message, and have some other node issue it into the network if the node does not have any neighbors yet. 

Nodes will keep track of these `salt declaration` messages to update the declared initial salt of their known peers list.

Assuming a salt update at time interval of 3 hours, after about 3 years, a node’s salt chain will run out. It can then set a new salt chain with a new initial salt declaration. The new salt declaration time should occur 30,000 hours after the last salt declaration time. Dishonest new salt declarations can be ignored.

### Hash chain

An example of hash-chain implementation is shown in the following Go code:

```
hashChain := make([][32]byte, 10000)
data := []byte("Secret seed")
for i := 0; i < 10000; i++ {
    hashChain[i] = blake2b.Sum256(data)
    copy(data[:], hashChain[i][:])
}
```

Note that such operation takes ~2ms to be computed on a modern laptop.
