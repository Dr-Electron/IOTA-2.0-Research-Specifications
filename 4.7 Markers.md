# 4.7.1 Markers

This section defines the *Marker* tool.

# 4.7.2 Motivation

For certain applications we need to know, whether a certain message is in the past or future cone of another message. Furthermore, in order to compute the approval weight of a given message we need to traverse the Tangle from the message to the tips and sum up the active consensus mana of all the messages in its future cone. These operations can be numerically expensive.

The Marker tool allows to efficiently determine whether certain Markers are in the past or future cone of a given message, by reducing the proportion of the Tangle that needs to be traversed. Thus reducing significantly the effort to identify wether certain messages are in the past or future cone of another message. It also enables to efficiently estimate the approval weight of a message.

## Definitions

Let's define the terms related to Markers:
* **Marker:** A transaction that locally is assigned additional properties and that tracks a particular UTXO branch.
* **Marker Rank (`MR`):** The rank of a Marker in the Marker DAG.
* **Sequence:** A Sequence is a Sequence of Markers, where each Marker corresponds to same UTXO branch.
* **Sequence Identifier (`Sid`):** A Sequence Identifier is the unique identifier of a Sequence. 
* **Sequence rank (`SR`):** The rank of a Sequence in the Sequence DAG.
* **Future Marker (`FM`):** A future Marker of a message is the first Marker that is created in its future cone from different Sequences; this field in the message metadata is updated when the new Marker is generated in the future, following the rules defined in (#future-Markers).
* **Past Marker (`PM`):** A past Marker of a message is a Marker in its past cone. For a given Sequence it is set to the newest past Marker of its parents, that is the one that has the largest `MR`. The past Marker of a Marker is set to itself.


## The Markers

Markers are messages selected from the strong tips set at random, and selected from the weak tips set if there's no strong tip. They are assigned unique identifiers, in the form of $[\texttt{SI}, \texttt{MR}]$. 

A new Marker is created when: 
* a new Sequence is created.
* more than a certain number of messages have been received since the last Marker.
* a certain time window has passed.

The `SI` value is set according to the following rules:
* Inherit the `SI` from parents if the new Marker references the latest Marker of a Sequence and meets the requirement to set up a new Marker without initiating a new Marker Sequence.
* Create a new `SI` if it is the first Marker of a new Sequence.

The `MR` is set to `MR=1+max(referenced MR)`, which complies to the rule:
+ Marker ranks are monotonically increasing such that $\forall x \in fc(y)$ => $\texttt{MR}_x > \texttt{MR}_y$, where $fc(y)$ is the future cone of $y$ and $x$ is any message in that future cone.


## The Sequence
Sequences are used to track the UTXO DAG branches, each branch corresponds to a Sequence with a unique `Sid`, and the Sequences form a DAG. Each Sequence is associated with some meta data:

### Sequence data

Each Sequence is associated with some data. In particular this is

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>Sid</code> </td>
        <td>uint64</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>SR</code></td>
        <td>uint64</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>MR_max</code></td>
        <td>uint64</td>
        <td>The highest <code>MR</code> of the own Marker Sequence.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>MR_min</code></td>
        <td>uint64</td>
        <td>The lowest <code>MR</code> of the own Marker Sequence.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>ParentReferences</code></td>
        <td>map[<code>Sid</code>] Reference</td>
        <td>Relationship map to parent Sequence Markers*</td>
    </tr>
</table>


*The field `ParentReferences` models the relationship between Sequences by providing a way to encode which Marker in the Sequence references which other Markers from other Sequences. For a given Sequence the list of indexes of type `Sid` in the map does not alter, since they define the Sequence, however the references may.



### Creation of Sequences
A new Sequence is created when:
1. there's a conflict in a UTXO branch.
2. the UTXO branches are aggregated.
3. UTXO branches are merged.

Each new Sequence starts with a new Marker.
