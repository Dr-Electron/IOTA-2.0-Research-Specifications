# 4.7.1 Markers

This section defines the *Marker* tool. A tool is a feature that adds functionality but is not an essential component. The Marker tool improves the efficiency to check certain properties or calculate certain metrics.

More specifically, the following operations can become  numerically expensive:
* **Future- or past cone inclusion**. For certain applications we need to know, whether a certain message is in the past or future cone of another message. In its most basic approach the Tangle has to be walked until a given message is found.
* **Approval weight**. In order to compute the approval weight of a given message we need to traverse the Tangle from that message to the tips and sum up the active consensus mana of all the messages in its future cone. 

The Marker tool allows to efficiently determine whether certain Markers are in the past or future cone of a given message, by reducing the proportion of the Tangle that needs to be traversed. Thus reducing significantly the effort to identify wether certain messages are in the past or future cone of another message. It also enables to efficiently estimate the approval weight of a message.

## Definitions

Let's define the terms related to Markers:
* **UTXO branch:** This is a set of outputs that spawn off from a conflict, i.e. reference a conflict. Each combination of conflicts spawns a new UTXO branch.
* **Main branch:** The part of the UTXO DAG, in which all outputs are considered to be good. In the sense that all conflicts in their past have been resolved, either by a given conflict message being accepted or rejected. 
* **Marker:** A message that locally is assigned additional properties and that tracks a particular UTXO branch.
* **Rank:** For a given DAG the rank is defined as an incrasing index for the verteces of that DAG. More specifically, if a vertice $A$ references $B$ and $C$ then $rank(A)=max(rank(B),rank(C))+1$.
* **Marker Rank (`MR`):** The rank of a Marker in the Marker DAG.
* **Cluster:** A Cluster is a group of Markers, where each Marker corresponds to same UTXO branch.
* **Cluster Identifier (`Cid`):** A Cluster Identifier is a number that uniquely identifies a Cluster.
* **Cluster rank (`CR`):** The rank of a Cluster in the Cluster DAG.
* **Future Marker (`FM`):** This field in the message metadata is (potentially) updated when a new Marker is generated in the future cone of the message, following the rules defined in Section "Metadata of messages". Essentially it contains the list of Markers for which there is no other Marker between the Marker in question and the message.
* **Past Marker (`PM`):** The Past Marker of a message is the most recent Past Marker of the parents of its elements (with respect to `MR`). The Past Marker of a Marker is set to itself.


## The Markers

Markers are messages selected from the strong tips set at random, and selected from the weak tips set if there's no strong tip. They are assigned unique identifiers, which we call **Marker Detail**, and which take  the form

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Type</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>Cid</code></td>
        <td>int</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>MR</code></td>
        <td>int</td>
    </tr>
</table>

A new Marker is created (by selecting and marking a recent message as Past Marker) when any of the following conditions are met: 
* a new UTXO branch is created. This also creates a new Cluster.
* more than a certain number of messages (`maxMsgPerMarker`) have been received since the last Marker.
* a certain time window (`maxTimePerMarker`) has passed since the last Marker.


Since $\texttt{MR}(x)=1+\max \limits_{y: x\text{ references }y}\texttt{MR}(y)$, Marker ranks are monotonically non-decreasing such that 
$\forall x \in fc(y) \Rightarrow \texttt{MR}_x > \texttt{MR}_y$, 
where $fc(y)$ is the future cone of $y$.


The `Cid` value is set according to the following rules:
* Create a new `Cid` if it is the first Marker of a new Cluster.
* Inherit the `Cid` from parents if the new Marker does not start a new Cluster. 

A new created `Cid` must be unique. 

## The Cluster
Clusters are used to track the UTXO DAG branches, each branch corresponds to a Cluster with a unique `Cid`, and the Clusters form a DAG. Each Cluster is associated with some meta data:

### Cluster data

Each Cluster is associated with some data, namely:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>Cid</code></td>
        <td>int</td>  
        <td>(see Definitions)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>CR</code></td>
        <td>int</td>
        <td>(see Definitions)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>MR_max</code></td>
        <td>int</td>
        <td>The highest <code>MR</code> in the Cluster</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>MR_min</code></td>
        <td>int</td>
        <td>The lowest <code>MR</code> in the Cluster</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>ParentReferences </code></td>
        <td>map[<code>Cid</code>] <code>Cid</code></td>
        <td>Relationship map to Markers from  parent Clusters  (*) </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br/>

 *The field `ParentReferences` models the relationship between Clusters, more specifically it maps, which Marker in this Cluster references which other Markers from other Clusters. 

Whenever a new Cluster is created, we assign a new $\texttt{CR}=1+max(\text{referenced }\texttt{CR})$. To prevent assigning a new `Cid` when combining the same Clusters again, we build parents-child relationships in a map if a new Cluster is created. 

Whenever a new Marker is added that is a member of the Cluster, `MR_max` and `ParentReferences` are updated. 

### Creation of Clusters


A new Cluster is created when:
1. there's a conflict in a UTXO branch.
2. the UTXO branches are aggregated.
3. UTXO branches are merged.

Each new Cluster starts with a new Marker. 

For further details about the UTXO model, we refer to the Section ???UTXO???.


## Metadata of messages

Each message maintains metadata that provides information about the markers that lie in the past or future cone of the message, as well as whether the message itself is a marker and what rank the message has:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>MR</code></td>
        <td>int</td>
        <td>The Marker rank of the message.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>IsMarker</code></td>
        <td>bool</td>
        <td>A flag to indicate whether a message is a marker.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>PastMarker</code></td>
        <td>[<code>Cid</code>]<code>MR</code></td>
        <td>The list of the PMs from different Clusters in the past of the message.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>FutureMarkers</code></td>
        <td>map[<code>Cid</code>]<code>MR</code></td>
        <td>The list of the FMs from different Clusters in the future of the message.</td>     
    </tr>
</table>


# 

The `PastMarker` field contains 
* the Marker Detail of itself, if the message is a marker.
* the Marker Detail of its closest PMs, i.e. from each referenced Cluster only the markers with the highest MR. Furthermore, Markers which are referenced by other Markers in this list are also removed, such that the list only contains the 'tips' of the Marker DAG.

The `FutureMarkers` list is empty at start and gets updated when a new marker directly or indirectly references it. 
The propagation of a FM to its past cone (i.e. the update of the `FutureMarkers` list in the encountered messages) does not continue beyond a message if:
1. `FutureMarkers` of a message includes a previous marker of the same Cluster;
2. the message is the marker in a different Cluster. Then we update `FutureMarkers` of that marker only.

Here is an example of how the Markers and Clusters would look in the Tangle from the perspective of the Message DAG, the Marker DAG and the Cluster DAG
(the purple colored messages are markers):

## Approval weight

To approximate the approval weight of a message, we simply retrieve the approval weight of `FutureMarkers`. Since the message is in the past cone of its FMs, the approval weight and the finality will be at least the same as its FMs. This will of course be a lower bound (which is the “safe” bound), but if the markers are set frequently enough, it should be a good approximation.

## Past cone check

By comparing the `PastMarker` of a message with the `FutureMarkers` of another message, we can tell if one is in the others past cone. However, it is also possible the Marker DAG does not cover certain areas of the message DAG yet, and thus a check on this question can get the three values:

* `True` 
* `False` 
* `Maybe`

If the check returns a `Maybe`, then the Message DAG must be searched via a walk.
