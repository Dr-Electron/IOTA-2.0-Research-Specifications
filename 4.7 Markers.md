# 4.7.1 Markers

This section defines the *Marker* tool. A tool is a feature that adds functionality but is not an essential component. The Marker tool improves the efficiency to check certain properties or calculate certain metrics.

More specifically, the following operations can become  numerically expensive:
* **Future- or past cone inclusion**. For certain applications we need to know, whether a certain message is in the past or future cone of another message. In its most basic approach the Tangle has to be walked until a given message is found.
* **Approval weight**. In order to compute the approval weight of a given message we need to traverse the Tangle from that message to the tips and sum up the active consensus mana of all the messages in its future cone. 

The Marker tool allows to efficiently determine whether certain Markers are in the past or future cone of a given message, by reducing the proportion of the Tangle that needs to be traversed. Thus reducing significantly the effort to identify wether certain messages are in the past or future cone of another message. It also enables to efficiently estimate the approval weight of a message.

## Definitions

Let's define the terms related to Markers:
* **UTXO branch:** This is a set of outputs that spawn off from a conflict transaction. For more information on UTXO visit Section ???UTXO???.
* **Main branch:** The part of the UTXO DAG, in which all outputs are considered to be good. In the sense that all conflicts in their past have been resolved, either by a given conflict being accepted or rejected. 
* **Rank:** For a given DAG the rank is defined as an incrasing index for the verteces of that DAG. More specifically, if a vertice $A$ references $B$ and $C$ then $rank(A)=max(rank(B),rank(C))+1$.
* **Marker:** A message that is assigned, locally on the node, additional properties and that tracks a particular UTXO branch.
* **Marker Identifier (`Mid`):** The unique identifier of the Marker
* **Marker Rank (`MR`):** The rank of a Marker in the Marker DAG.
* **Cluster:** A Cluster is a group of Markers. Each Cluster corresponds to a UTXO branch.
* **Cluster Identifier (`Cid`):** A Cluster Identifier is a number that uniquely identifies a Cluster.
* **Cluster rank (`CR`):** The rank of a Cluster in the Cluster DAG.
* **Future Marker (`FM`):** This field in the message metadata is (potentially) updated when a new Marker is generated in the future cone of the message, following the rules defined in Section "Metadata of messages". Essentially it contains the list of Markers for which there is no other Marker between the Marker in question and the message.
* **Past Marker (`PM`):** A Past Marker of a message is a most recent (with respect to `MR`) Past Marker of the parents. The Past Marker of a Marker is set to itself.


## The Markers

Messages are selected from the strong tips set at random and according to certain rules (see below). If there is no strong tip the selection happens on the weak tips set instead. A selected message is assigned as a Marker, which we call **Marker**. A Marker consists of the following data


### Marker data

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>Mid</code></td>
        <td>int</td>
        <td>unique identifier / pointer to the Marker</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>Cid</code></td>
        <td>int</td>
        <td>Cluster identifier</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>MR</code></td>
        <td>int</td>
        <td>Marker Rank</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br>

A new Marker is created (by selecting and marking a recent message as Past Marker) when any of the following conditions are met: 
* a new UTXO branch is created. This also creates a new Cluster.
* more than a certain number of messages (`maxMsgPerMarker`) have been received since the last Marker.
* a certain time window (`maxTimePerMarker`) has passed since the last Marker.


Since $\texttt{MR}(x)=1+\max \limits_{y: x\text{ references }y}\texttt{MR}(y)$, Marker ranks are monotonically non-decreasing such that 
$\forall x \in fc(y) \Rightarrow \texttt{MR}_x > \texttt{MR}_y$, 
where $fc(y)$ is the future cone of $y$.


The `Cid` value is set according to the following rules:
* Create a new `Cid` if it is the first Marker of a new Cluster.
* Inherit the `Cid` from parents if the new Marker does not start a new Cluster. 

A new created `Cid` must be unique. 

## The Cluster
Clusters are used to track the UTXO DAG branches, each branch corresponds to a Cluster with a unique `Cid`, and the Clusters form a DAG. Each Cluster is associated with some meta data:

### Cluster data

Each Cluster is associated with some data, namely:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>Cid</code></td>
        <td>int</td>  
        <td>(see Definitions)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>CR</code></td>
        <td>int</td>
        <td>(see Definitions)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>MR_max</code></td>
        <td>int</td>
        <td>The highest <code>MR</code> in the Cluster</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>MR_min</code></td>
        <td>int</td>
        <td>The lowest <code>MR</code> in the Cluster</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>ParentReferences </code></td>
        <td>map[<code>Marker</code>] <code>Marker</code></td>
        <td>Relationship map to Markers from  parent Clusters  (*) </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br/>

 *The field `ParentReferences` models the relationship between Clusters, more specifically it maps, which Marker in this Cluster references which other Markers from other Clusters. 

Whenever a new Cluster is created, we assign a new $\texttt{CR}=1+max(\text{referenced }\texttt{CR})$. To prevent assigning a new `Cid` when combining the same Clusters again, we build parents-child relationships in a map if a new Cluster is created. 

Whenever a new Marker is added that is a member of the Cluster, `MR_max` and `ParentReferences` are updated. 

### Creation of Clusters


A new Cluster is created when:
1. there's a conflict in a UTXO branch.
2. the UTXO branches are aggregated.
3. UTXO branches are merged.

Each new Cluster starts with a new Marker. 

For further details about the UTXO model, we refer to the Section ???UTXO???.


## Metadata of messages

Each message maintains metadata that provides information about the Markers that are closest in the past or future cone of the message, as well as whether the message itself is a Marker and what rank the message has:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>IsMarker</code></td>
        <td>bool</td>
        <td>A flag to indicate whether a message is a Marker.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>PastMarkers</code></td>
        <td>map[<code>Cid</code>]<code>Mid</code></td>
        <td>A list of the closest Markers from different Clusters in the past cone of the message.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>FutureMarkers</code></td>
        <td>map[<code>Cid</code>]<code>Mid</code></td>
        <td>A list of the closest Markers from different Clusters in the future cone of the message.</td>     
    </tr>
</table>
<br>

The `PastMarkers` field contains 
* only the Marker identifier of itself, if the message is marked as a Marker.
* the Marker identifier of its closest PMs, i.e. from each referenced Cluster only the Markers with the highest MR. Furthermore, Markers which are referenced by other Markers in this list are also removed.

The `FutureMarkers` list is empty at start and gets updated when a new Marker directly or indirectly references it. 
The propagation of a FM to its past cone (i.e. the update of the `FutureMarkers` list in the encountered messages) does not continue beyond a message if:
1. `FutureMarkers` of a message includes a previous Marker of the same Cluster; the message that includes such a Marker does not get updated.
2. the message is the Marker in a different Cluster. Then we update `FutureMarkers` of that Marker only.

Here is an example of how the Markers and Clusters (here also called Sequence) would look in the Tangle from the perspective of the Message DAG, the Marker DAG and the Cluster DAG
(the purple colored messages are Markers):

## Approval weight

To approximate the approval weight of a message, we simply retrieve the approval weight of `FutureMarkers`. Since a given message is in the past cone of its FMs, the approval weight and thus the finality of the message will be at least the same as the maximum weight of its FMs. This will of course be a lower bound (which is the “safe” bound), but if the Markers are set frequently enough, it should provide a good approximation. 



## Past cone check

By comparing the `PastMarkers` of a message with the `FutureMarkers` of another message, we can tell if one is in the others past cone. 

This check can be done by traversing the Marker DAG while remaining in the bounds of the Marker ranks. As an optimisation the Cluster DAG can be traversed while considering the Cluster ranks, prior to any traversal of the Marker DAG.

Note, it is also possible the Marker DAG does not cover certain areas of the message DAG yet, and thus a check on this question can get the three values:

* `True` 
* `False` 
* `Maybe`

If the check returns a `Maybe`, then the Message DAG must be searched via a search algorithm.
