- **Generic Data Object:** Base typ  Every payload must support the Generic Data Object type which Most basic type of object, composed of size followed by data and supported by all payloads. 
    
- **Version number:**
    
-  **Tangle:** An append only data structure of objects where each object contains the hashes of two other objects.

- **Node:**
    
-   **Gossip Layer/Layer 0:** Layer that deals with nodes network and how the protocol uses TCP.
    
-   **Communication Layer/Layer 1:** The base layer where information is communicated and stored.
