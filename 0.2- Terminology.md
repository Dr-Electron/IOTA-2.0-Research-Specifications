 - **Object:** An unit which contains data. It always begins with a type  and size. The type determines how the object will be parsed.
    
- **Payload:** A field of the object which can be filled with another object. Object types require that their payloads support objects of a particular type. 

- **“X payload”:** A payload with a type X object.
    
- **Generic Data Object:** Base typ  Every payload must support the Generic Data Object type which Most basic type of object, composed of size followed by data and supported by all payloads. 
    
- **Version number:**
    
-  **Tangle:** An append only data structure of objects where each object contains the hashes of two other objects.
    
-   **Gossip Layer/Layer 0:** Layer that deals with nodes network. It also governs how the protocol uses TCP.
    
-   Layer 1: The Communication Layer: the base layer where information is communicated and stored.
    

-   This layer primarily deals with an object type called message. Messages are the only object that will be gossiped. All information stored on the distributed database will be contained in a message.
    
-   Messages will be stored in the Message Tangle. This means that every message contains the hashes of two other messages.
    
-   Since messages are objects, they also have a version number.
    
-   Messages must be well-formed
    

-   Layer 2: Application layer: An application uses the communication layer via objects in the payloads of messages. A protocol must specify and define object types that the application uses, how to create these objects, and how to parse them.
    

-   Nodes choose which applications to run. Moreover, anyone can develop an application.
    
-   All nodes must run some core applications. Examples include the Value Transfer Application.
    

-   Recall that for an object type X, a payload must support a specific object type Y. In this case, we say that Y is a core payload of X.
    

-   Messages have the following core payload types. Informally, these (and their core payloads) may be referred to as the core object types.
    

-   Value Objects
    
-   DRNG Objects
    
-   Opinion Objects
    
-   Salt Declaration Objects
    
-   Generic Data Objects
    

-   Informally, an X message is a message with payload type X, eg a value message has a value payload.
    
-   Unless variable, the size of a core payload type can be omitted. Similarly, if a payload supports only one object type, the type can also be omitted. For example, value objects can only have transactions as payloads. Thus, we can omit the type and size of the transaction.
    

-   Value Transfer Application: The value transfer protocol governs how funds are transferred. The value transfer application runs on top of this protocol and maintains the value tangle and the ledger state
    

-   Value objects comprise the value tangle.
    
-   Transaction: a transaction is the payload of a value message. Transactions are the only type supported in value object payloads. They contain
    

-   The input addresses and input transactions
    
-   The destination addresses
    
-   The mana the node is pledged to
    
-   A payload
    
-   A signature which signs everything listed above> Written with [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/).
