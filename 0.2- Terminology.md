 - **Object:** An unit which contains data. It always begins with a type  and size. The type determines how the object will be parsed.
    
- **Payload:** A field of the object which can be filled with another object. Object types require that their payloads support objects of a particular type. 

- **“X payload”:** A payload with a type X object.
    
- **Generic Data Object:** Base typ  Every payload must support the Generic Data Object type which Most basic type of object, composed of size followed by data and supported by all payloads. 
    
- **Version number:**
    
-  **Tangle:** An append only data structure of objects where each object contains the hashes of two other objects.

- **Node:**
    
-   **Gossip Layer/Layer 0:** Layer that deals with nodes network and how the protocol uses TCP.
    
-   **Communication Layer/Layer 1:** The base layer where information is communicated and stored.
    
-   **Application Layer/Layer 2:** The Layer composed of applications that uses the communication layer via objects in the payloads of messages.
- **Application:**

-   **Messages:** Base object of Layer 1.
    
-   **Message Tangle:** 
    
- **Core Application:** An application that all nodes are required to be capable of running.
- **Value Transfer Application:**
    
    

-   Messages have the following core payload types. Informally, these (and their core payloads) may be referred to as the core object types.
    

-   Value Objects
    
-   DRNG Objects
    
-   Opinion Objects
    
-   Salt Declaration Objects
    
-   Generic Data Objects
    

-   Informally, an X message is a message with payload type X, eg a value message has a value payload.
    
-   Unless variable, the size of a core payload type can be omitted. Similarly, if a payload supports only one object type, the type can also be omitted. For example, value objects can only have transactions as payloads. Thus, we can omit the type and size of the transaction.
    

-   Value Transfer Application: The value transfer protocol governs how funds are transferred. The value transfer application runs on top of this protocol and maintains the value tangle and the ledger state
    

-   Value objects comprise the value tangle.
    
-   Transaction: a transaction is the payload of a value message. Transactions are the only type supported in value object payloads. They contain
    

-   The input addresses and input transactions
    
-   The destination addresses
    
-   The mana the node is pledged to
    
-   A payload
    
-   A signature which signs everything listed above> Written with [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/).
