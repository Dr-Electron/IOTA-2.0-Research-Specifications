 - **Object:** An unit which contains data. It always begins with a type  and size. The type determines how the object will be parsed.
    
- **Payload:** A field of the object which can be filled with another object. Object types require that their payloads support objects of a particular type. 

- **X payload/Payload type X:** A payload with a type X object.
    
- **Generic Data Object:** Base typ  Every payload must support the Generic Data Object type which Most basic type of object, composed of size followed by data and supported by all payloads. 
    
- **Version number:**
    
-  **Tangle:** An append only data structure of objects where each object contains the hashes of two other objects.

- **Node:**
    
-   **Gossip Layer/Layer 0:** Layer that deals with nodes network and how the protocol uses TCP.
    
-   **Communication Layer/Layer 1:** The base layer where information is communicated and stored.
    
-   **Application Layer/Layer 2:** The Layer composed of applications that uses the communication layer via objects in the payloads of messages.
- **Application:**

-   **Messages:** Base object of Layer 1.
    
-   **Message Tangle:** 
    
- **Core Application:** An application that all nodes are required to be capable of running.
    
- **Value Transfer Application:**
    
- **Core Payload:** We say Y is a core payload of the object X if X must support the object contained in Y. (??)
    
-   **Value Object:**
    
-   **DRNG Object:**
    
-   **Opinion Object:**
    
-   **Salt Declaration Object:**
  

-  **X Message:** A message with payload type X.
    

-   **Value Transfer Application: The value transfer protocol governs how funds are transferred. The value transfer application runs on top of this protocol and maintains the value tangle and the ledger state
    

-   Value objects comprise the value tangle.
    
-   Transaction: a transaction is the payload of a value message. Transactions are the only type supported in value object payloads. They contain
    

-   The input addresses and input transactions
    
-   The destination addresses
    
-   The mana the node is pledged to
    
-   A payload
    
-   A signature which signs everything listed above> Written with [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/).
