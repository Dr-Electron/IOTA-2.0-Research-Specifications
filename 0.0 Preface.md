Over the past two years, our researchers have been working in groups on different aspects of Coordicide. During the past couple of months, each research group drafted specifications of the protocol components within their purview. Earlier this month, the Research Department met for the first time since travel restrictions began, and we carefully reviewed the specifications. This was a wonderful opportunity to take a holistic view of all the components together as a team. Although we corrected some minor errors, and found some small gaps, we were very pleased with our work. Following this meeting, we combined the individual specifications into the document released here.

  

The overall architecture and general protocol is clearly presented. All the core components are described in sufficient detail that the prototype team can begin implementing them in GoShimmer. We can find no major problems, and we believe all the fundamental research questions have been sufficiently answered. Our confidence in our solution is why we have recently begun engaging academica through our Coordicide grant program to provide independent review.

  

That said, astute readers of the specifications will notice some remaining gaps. Indeed some content remains to be added to certain aspects of the specifications. As you read, please keep in mind that many specifications still lack engineering specific implementation details. Please note that this is why we refer to this document as our “research specifications.” In particular, the following points need to be clarified in the specifications:

  

-   How nodes synchronize: When a new node comes online, it downloads the recent messages and transactions from its neighbours. However, it cannot verify the outcomes of FPC voting on these transactions. We plan to record FPC votes in the tangle with the mana of the nodes issuing messages in the future cone. However, there is no specification on how to do this. As such, one immediate priority for our team is to fill this gap.
    
-   [Reality based ledger state](https://iota.cafe/t/parallel-reality-based-ledger-state-using-utxo/261): GoShimmer uses parallel reality based ledger state. However, this does not appear in the specifications. Moreover, these ideas need to be incorporated with the Value Transfer Application specification, which should simplify this specification.
    
-   Message creation: Although the process by which messages are created is implied by many of the specifications, the exact steps are not enumerated on a single page. We intend to spell this out in clearer detail in future versions.
    

  

Furthermore, some aspects of the specifications do not fully match the code in GoShimmer. There are two reasons for this. First, in order to get Pollen running, several modules were implemented ad hoc, knowing they would be replaced by the proper implementation for Nectar. This is because, for example, several modules require mana, which is not implemented in Pollen. Thus, temporary measures were implemented. Second, while coding GoShimmer, certain modules were designed and implemented without first being formalized in the specifications, such as the reality based ledger state.  
  
As we develop GoShimmer, we will continue to edit the specifications, so that eventually the codebase and the specifications will converge. Thus, the specifications will continue to evolve until GoShimmer reaches the Honey phase. Furthermore, GoShimmer itself is a rapid prototyping tool whose purpose is to reveal desired revisions or optimizations.

  

As the specifications solidify around their mainnet-ready form, we are grateful for greater involvement from Foundation members with expertise in standardization and the requirements from an engineering perspective. Eventually, the implementation of IOTA 2.0 will be based on very detailed engineering-oriented specifications which evolve from these documents. The goal of this entire process is to [standardize the IOTA protocol](https://medium.com/@mikehypercube/2deca99b0396).
