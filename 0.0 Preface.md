Over the past two years, our researchers have been working in groups on different aspects of Coordicide. During the past couple of months, each research group drafted specifications of the protocol components within their purview. Earlier this month, the Research Department met for the first time since travel restrictions began. The goal for this meeting was to scrutinize our work and check the specifications for completeness. Although we corrected some minor errors and found some small remaining gaps (explained below), we were very pleased with our work. Following this meeting, we combined the individual specifications into the document released here.

  

In these specifications, the overall architecture and general IOTA 2.0 protocol is clearly presented. All the core components are described in sufficient detail that the prototype team can progress with the implementation on Pollen. We can find no major problems, and we believe all the fundamental research questions have been sufficiently answered. Our confidence in our solution is why we have recently begun engaging academia through our [Coordicide grant program](https://coordicide.iota.org/grants) to provide independent review of our work.

  

That said, these specifications have alpha status, which means they are not stable and will continue to evolve. Astute readers of the specifications will notice some remaining gaps. Indeed some content remains to be added to certain aspects of the specifications. As you read, please keep in mind that many specifications still lack engineering specific implementation details. Please note that this is why we refer to this document as our “research specifications.” In particular, the following points need to be clarified in the specifications:

  

-   How nodes synchronize: When a new node comes online, it downloads the recent messages and transactions from its neighbours. However, it cannot verify the outcomes of FPC voting on these transactions. We plan to record FPC votes in the Tangle with the mana of the nodes issuing messages in the future cone. However, there is no specification on how to do this. As such, one immediate priority for our team is to fill this gap.
    
-   [Parallel reality based ledger state](https://iota.cafe/t/parallel-reality-based-ledger-state-using-utxo/261): Pollen uses parallel reality based ledger state. However, this does not appear in the specifications. Moreover, these ideas need to be incorporated with the Value Transfer Application specification, which should simplify this specification.
    
-   Message creation: Although the process by which messages are created is implied by many of the specifications, the exact steps are not enumerated on a single page. We intend to spell this out in clearer detail in future versions.
    

  

Furthermore, some aspects of the specifications do not fully match the code in Pollen. There are two reasons for this. First, in order to get Pollen running, several modules were implemented ad hoc, knowing they would be replaced by the proper implementation for Nectar. This is because, for example, several modules require mana, which is not yet implemented in Pollen. Thus, temporary measures were implemented. Second, while coding Pollen, certain modules were designed and implemented without first being formalized in the specifications, such as the Parallel reality based ledger state.  
  
As we continue to develop Pollen, we will continue to edit the specifications, so that eventually the codebase and the specifications will converge. Thus, the specifications will continue to evolve until Honey is released. Furthermore, GoShimmer itself is a rapid prototyping tool whose primary purpose is to reveal desired revisions or optimizations.

  

As the specifications solidify around their mainnet-ready form, we are grateful for greater involvement from Foundation members with expertise in standardization and the requirements from an engineering perspective. Eventually, the implementation of IOTA 2.0 will be based on very detailed engineering-oriented specifications which evolve from these documents. In addition, we will produce high level protocol specifications which will [standardize the IOTA protocol](https://medium.com/@mikehypercube/2deca99b0396), and will allow anyone to build their own node software from scratch.

  

Despite the evolving nature of the current specifications document, we feel that it is important to make our work visible to the public, both for transparency as well as feedback. As is always the case, we know the community members enjoy monitoring our progress as we refine our ideas and fill in the details, so we’re glad to finally have you along for this part of the ride. As always, we welcome feedback from the community and academics alike about our work.
