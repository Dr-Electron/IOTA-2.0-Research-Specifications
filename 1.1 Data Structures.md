This section will contain detail schematics of the message layout, and the core protocol layouts.

# Data Structures

In the future, we will provide detailed outlines of all the data types used in IOTA 2.0.  However, currently we provide informal outlines.  

The IOTA protocol communicates information in units we call objects.  Every object has a type and size.  Every object type will be formally defined using a schema.  Any application can define its own special object types, however certain core object types will be recognized by all nodes.  One of the core object types will be a generic data object, and all unrecognized objects will be treated as such.

Objects have an optional payload field (or in fact several payloads).   A payload field always contains an object.  An object type can specify which object types is supports as payloads.  

All information gossiped in the Iota protocol will be contained in the payload of an object type called message.

Messages contain all the information required by the communication layer: See Chapter 3.  Paylaods are then parsed on the application layer.  Thus the object payload structure allows us to delineate between between the communication and application layers. 

The most crucial application is the Value Transfer Application, which deals with moving funds: see Section 4.1.  Funds are moved in an object type called transaction.  Transactions are stored in the value tangle, and thus are the payload of value objects, which are one of the possible payloads of a message.

Transactions also have an optional payload feild.
