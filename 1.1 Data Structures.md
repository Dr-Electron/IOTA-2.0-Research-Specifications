# Data Structures

In the future, we will provide detailed outlines of all the data types used in IOTA 2.0.  However, currently we provide informal outlines.  

The IOTA protocol communicates information in units we call objects.  Every object has a type and size.  Every object type will be formally defined using a schema.  Any application can define its own special object types, however certain core object types will be recognized by all nodes.  

All information gossiped between nodes will be contained
