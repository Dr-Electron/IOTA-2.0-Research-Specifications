This section will contain detail schematics of the message layout, and the core protocol layouts.

# Data Structures

In the future, we will provide detailed outlines of all the data types used in IOTA 2.0.  However, currently we provide informal outlines.  

The IOTA protocol communicates information in units we call objects.  Every object has a type and size.  Every object type will be formally defined using a schema.  Any application can define its own special object types, however certain core object types will be recognized by all nodes.  One of the core object types will be a generic data object, and all unrecognized objects will be treated as such.

Objects have an optional payload field (or in fact several payloads).   A payload field always contains an object.  An object type can define the types which are supported as payloads.
