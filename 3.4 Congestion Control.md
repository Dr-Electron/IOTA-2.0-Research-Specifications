# 3.4 Congestion control [spec]

This specification is part of [Coordicide](https://coordicide.iota.org/).  
Further information can be found in a related [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07778).

## 3.4.1 Summary

Every network has to deal with its intrinsic limited resources in terms of bandwidth and node capabilities (CPU and storage). In this document, we present a congestion control algorithm to regulate the influx of messages in the network with the goal of maximizing throughput and minimizing delays. Furthermore, the following requirements must be satisfied:

*   _Consistency_. If a message is written by one correct node, it should be written by all correct nodes within some delay bound.
*   _Fairness_. All nodes should get a fair share of throughput, achieving max-min fairness in the number of messages issued by each node during congestion, weighted by mana.
*   _Security_. Malicious nodes should be unable to interfere with either of the above requirements.

### 3.4.1.1 Current implementation

The module described in this specification does not replace any existing mechanism.

### 3.4.1.2 Proposal

Our proposal has three core components: (i) a scheduling algorithm which ensures fair access for all nodes according to their mana; (ii) a TCP-inspired algorithm for decentralized rate setting to utilize the bottleneck while preventing delays; (iii) a blacklisting policy to ban malicious behavior.

### 3.4.1.3 Prerequisites

_Node identity_. We require node accountability where each message is associated with the global identifier of its issuing node.

_Mana_. The congestion control module has knowledge of the reputation of all nodes (mana) in order to fairly share the total throughput. Without mana the network is subject to Sybil attacks, and the thoughput is equally shared between nodes.

## 3.4.2 Congestion control algorithm

### 3.4.2.1 Outbox management

Once the message has successfully passed the parser checks, it is enqueued into the outbox for scheduling. In this section, we describe the operations of message enqueuing (and dequeuing) into (from) the outbox.

The enqueue mechanism is made of the following:

*   _Classification_. The mechanism identifies the queue where the message belongs to according to the node ID of the message issuer. It is also possible to use a private salt to avoid DoS attacks (although it may be unnecessary if a rate control mechanism is in place).
*   _Message enqueue_. The message is actually enqueued, queue is sorted by message timestamps and counters are updated (e.g., counters for the total number of bytes in the queue).
*   _Message drop_. In some circumstances, due to newtork congestion or to ongoing attacks, some messages should be dropped to guarantee bounded delays and isolate attacker's messages. Specifically, we drop messages in two situations: (i) since buffers are of a limited size, if the total number of bytes in all queues exceeds a certain threshold, new incoming messages are dropped; (ii) to prevent network security, if a certain queue exceeds a given threshold, new incoming packets from that specific node ID will be dropped.

The dequeue mechanism is made of the following:

*   _Queue selection_. A queue is selected according to a modified version of the deficit round robin (DRR) algorithm.
*   _Message dequeue_. The last message of the queue is dequeued, and counters are updated.
*   _Scheduler management_. Deficit counters and round robin pointers are updated.

### 3.4.2.2 Scheduler

The most critical task is the actual scheduling algorithm which must guarantee that, for a honest node _m_, the following requirements will be met: (i) _m_’s messages will not become backlogged at any node, so _consistency_ will be ensured; (ii) _m_’s fair share of the network resources are allocated to it, guaranteeing _fairness_; (iii) malicious nodes sending above their allowed rate will not interrupt _m_’s throughput, fulfilling the _security_ requirement.

Although nodes in our setting are capable of more complex and customised behaviour than a typical router in a packet-switched network, our scheduler must still be lightweight and scalable due to the potentially large number of nodes requiring differentiated treatment. It is estimated that over 10,000 nodes operate on the Bitcoin network, and we expect that an even greater number of nodes are likely to be present in the IoT setting. For this reason, we adopt a scheduler based on [DRR](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/502236). The Linux implementation of the [FQ-CoDel packet scheduler](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8290), which is based on DRR, supports anywhere up to 65535 separate queues.

Here a fundamental remark: _the network manager sets up a desired maximum (fixed) rate_ `1/r` _at which messages will be scheduled._ This rate mostly depends on the degree of decentralization desired: e.g., a larger rate leads to higher throughput but would leave behind slower devices which will fall out of sync. A way to dynamically adjust this rate is currently under investigation.

### 3.4.2.3 Rate setting

If all nodes always had messages to issue, the problem of rate setting would be very straightforward: nodes could simply operate at a fixed, assured rate. The scheduling algorithm ensures that this rate is enforceable, and that increasing delays or dropped messages are only experienced by misbehaving node. However, it is highly unlikely that all nodes will always have messages to issue, and we would like nodes to better utilise network resources, without causing excessive congestion and violating requirements.

Our rate setting algorithm is inspired by TCP — each node employs [additive increase, multiplicative decrease](https://https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611974225) (AIMD) rules to update their issue rate in response to congestion events. In the case of distributed ledgers, all messages traffic passes through all nodes, contrary to the case of traffic typically found in packet switched networks and other traditional network architectures. Under these conditions, local congestion at a node is all that is required to indicate congestion elsewhere in the network. This observation is crucial, as it presents an opportunity for a congestion control algorithm based entirely on local traffic.

Our rate setting algorithm outlines the AIMD rules employed by each node to set their issue rate. Rate updates take place each time a message is scheduled. Node _m_ sets its own local additive-increase parameter `α(m)` based on the global increase rate `A`, and its mana. An appropriate choice of `A` ensures a conservative global increase rate which does not cause problems even when many nodes increase their rate simultaneously. Nodes wait `τ` seconds after a multiplicative decrease (with global parameter `β`), during which there are no further updates made, to allow the reduced rate to take effect and prevent multiple successive decreases. At each update, node _m_ checks how many of its own messages are in its outbox queue, and responds with a multiplicative decrease if this number is above a threshold, `backoff(m)`, which is proportional to _m_’s reputation. If the number of _m_’s messages in outbox is below the threshold, _m_’s issue rate is incremented by its local increase parameter `α(m)`.

### 3.4.2.4 Message drop

If an incoming message made the outbox total buffer size exceeding its maximum capacity `maxBuffer`, the same message would be dropped. In our analysis, we assume buffers to be large enough to accommodate traffic from all honest nodes. As a future direction, we will investigate how to properly design buffer capacity to achieve an optimal tradeoff between efficiency (low delay) and consistency (low message drops).

To mitigate spamming actions from malicious nodes, we add an additional constraint: if _m_'s reputation-scaled queue length exceeds (i.e., queue length divided by node's reputation) a given threshold ```maxQueue```, any new incoming packet from _m_ will be dropped, hence the node is blacklisted.

## 3.4.3 Algorithm

### 3.4.3.1 Protocol variables

In line with the previous section, all nodes know the following global variables:

*   `float r`: minimum time interval between two scheduled messages
*   `float A`: global additive increase parameter
*   `float β`: global multiplicative decrease parameter (larger than 1)
*   `int τ`: time to wait before next rate's update after a backoff
*   `int maxBuffer`: maximum buffer size (in bytes)
*   `float maxQueue`: maximum mana-scaled inbox length
*   `float maxDeficit`: maximum cap for deficit accumulated

### 3.4.3.2 Node variables

*   `list activeNode`: updated list of nodes having at least one message in the outbox queue
*   `queue bufferQueue`: actual outbox queue where messages are ready to be scheduled
*   `pointer rrPointer`: pointer to _activeNode_ used by the round robin scheduler
*   `database nodeDB`: database with information related to mana and deficit counter
*   `float backoff`: local threshold for rate setting
*   `float α`: local additive increase parameter
*   `list blacklisted`: list of flags indicating if a specific nodeId is blacklisted

### 3.4.3.3 Pseudocode

#### `dc = getDeficit(nodeId)`

This function returns the value of the deficit counter given a certain _nodeId_. Information concerning all nodes is stored in _nodeDB_. It makes sense to include in this data structure both mana and deficit counters.
```python
    return nodeDB[nodeId].dc
```

#### `setDeficit(nodeId, value)`

This procedure sets to _value_ the value of the deficit counter of a certain _nodeId_. New nodes have their deficit initialized to `maxDeficit`.
```python
    return nodeDB[nodeId].dc
```

#### `mana = getAccessMana(nodeId)`

This function returns the value of the access mana given a certain _nodeId_ at _current time_. Information concerning all nodes is stored in _nodeDB_. It makes sense to include in this data structure both mana and deficit counters. More information about this function can be found in Section [4.3].
```python
    return nodeDB[nodeId].mana
```

#### `mana = getMana()`

This function returns the sum of access mana for all nodes at _current time_. More information about this function can be found in Section [4.3].
```python
    return sum(nodeDB.mana)
```

#### `updateDeficitCounter(nodeId, value)`

This procedure updates the deficit counter for a given node. The deficit counter can be either incremented by a value proportional to node’s mana or decremented when a message is scheduled.

```python
    if value == -1:

        if getDeficit(nodeId) < maxDeficit:
            # increase deficit if not max
            mana = getAccessMana(nodeId)
            setDeficit(nodeId, min(getDeficit(nodeId) + mana; maxDeficit))

    else:
        # decrease deficit when a message is scheduled
        setDeficit(nodeId, max(getDeficit(nodeId) - value; 0))
```

#### `α = getAdditiveParam()`

Get local additive parameter with up-to-date mana.
```python
    ### upon changes of node's mana (or initialization) ###

    return A * getAccessMana(self)/getMana()
```

#### `rateSetting()`

Update the rate `λ` at which messages can be issued by the node. The maximum value of `λ` depends on the physical limits of each node, that is the time needed to solve the Adaptive PoW. During the bootstrap, the value of `λ` is initialized with the output of `getAdditiveParam()`. The local variable `haltUpdate` is initialized to _0_.
```python
    # update issueing rate if no recent backoff
    if haltUpdate > 0:
        haltUpdate -= 1
    
    else:
        # retrieve message queue of the same node
        nodeQueue = activeNode*[self]
        
        if nodeQueue.size()/getAccessMana(self) > backoff:
            λ = λ / β
            haltUpdate = τ
        
        else:
            λ += getAdditiveParam()
```
#### `enqueue(msg)`

The procedure `enqueue(msg)` adds a new message `msg` into the outbox and updates the list of active nodes accordingly. The check on the buffer size (`bufferQueue.size() < maxBuffer`) may be performed by the parser checks.
```python
   ### upon arrival of a new message msg (having passed parser checks) ###

    if bufferQueue.size() < maxBuffer:

        nodeId = msg.nodeId

        if activeNode[nodeId] != NULL:
            # other messages from nodeId are already in the queue
            nodeQueue = activeNode*[nodeId]

            if (nodeQueue.size() + msg.size())/getAccessMana(nodeId) < maxQueue:
                # append msg
                bufferQueue.enqueue(msg)
                nodeQueue.tail() = bufferQueue.tail()
            
            else:
                # discard msg and blacklist nodeId
                blacklisted[nodeId] = TRUE
        else:
            # no other messages for nodeId are present in the buffer
            activeNode.add(msg.nodeId)
            bufferQueue.enqueue(msg)
            activeNode[msg.nodeId] = bufferQueue.tail()

```
#### `msg = schedule()`

At regular intervals, schedule the next message through DRR if there is at least one message in `bufferQueue`. Otherwise, return `NULL`.
```python
    ### every r time units ###

    if bufferQueue.size() > 0:
    
        # point to a nodeId with enough deficit
        while getDeficitCounter(activeNode[rrPointer]) < activeNode*[rrPointer].weight():
            rrPointer := rrPointer.next()
            updateDeficitCounter(activeNode[rrPointer], -1)
    
        # msg represents the message in the outbox       
        msg = activeNode*[rrPointer]
        updateDeficitCounter(activeNode[rrPointer].nodeId, msg.weight)
    
        # update queue pointers
        if msg.nodePtr == NULL:
            activeNode[rrPointer].remove()
        else:
            activeNode[rrPointer].ptr = msg.nodePtr

        # remove scheduled message from queue
        activeNode*[rrPointer].remove()    
        
        # self update of sending rate
        if msg.nodeId = self:   # currently testing this
            rateSetting(self)

        return msg

    else:
        return NULL
```

### 3.4.3.4 Data flow

The congestion control algorithm follows the _parser checks_ in the data flow: when a new message `msg` arrives to the scheduler, the function `enqueue(msg)` will be triggered in order to append it in the buffer. Furthermore, at regular intervals `1/r`, the function `schedule()` chooses a new message to be gossiped to neighbors and to be added to the local ledger. All the other functions and procedures mentioned in the rest of the section are called by `enqueue(msg)` or `schedule()`.

### 3.4.3.5 Data structures

In this section we describe the architectural components used to handle the outbox queue. This is mainly done through two data structures:

*   _activeNode_. It is a list which includes the node IDs of the nodes having at least one message in the outbox queue. Each node ID in the list points to its oldest message in the outbox buffer `bufferQueue`.
*   _bufferQueue_. It is the actual outbox queue. We can build overlapping virtual queues (indicated by colors in the figure) to represent different queues per node. This data structure has a limited fixed size (in terms of number of messages), and removes old messages according to a FIFO policy.

## 3.4.4 Under research

*   _Dynamic scheduling rate._ In the current proposal, the throughput is preset by the network manager. This value takes into account nodes’ hardware as well as bandwidth capacity. Hardware improvement or protocol optimizations will not result in a performance improvement if the network manager does not change the throughput parameter _r_. We are currently investigating a way to dynamically adapt the throughput according to the network and protocol characteristics based on neighbors health state.
*   _Self backoff._ We are investigating a better self back off condition to keep an average lower buffer length which can improve delays and decrease the probability that a honest node is blacklisted
*   _Blacklisting._ Condition for blacklisting should be improved to only punish truly malicious behavior. Furthermore, what to exactly do when a node is blacklisted is subject to further research: ideally, a node should be discarding all new incoming messages from the blacklisted node for a limited time and add this filter to the parser checks; other actions can also be taken into account.
*   _Deficit._ How is the deficit counter initialized? We have two options: (i) set the deficit counter equal to `maxDeficit` or (ii) equal to _0_. In the former, nodes will build deficit by not doing anything which may open up attack vectors; in the latter, transactions may propagate with large delays as nodes start build deficit only when a message arrives. An approach to mitigate this is to make `maxDeficit` proportional to node's _mana_.
*   _Rate setter updates_. Should the rate setter be called only when node's messages are scheduled?
