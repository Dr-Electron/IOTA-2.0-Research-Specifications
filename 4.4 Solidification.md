# 4.4 Solidification
A message is said to be **solid** on a node when all its parents are known to this node and also marked as solid.

If a node is missing a referenced message, it is stored in the **solidification buffer** and not yet processed. A node can ask its neighbors for the missing message by sending a **solidification request** containing the message hash. This process can be recursively repeated until all of a message's past cone until the genesis (or snapshot) become solid, which is known as **solidification**. In that way, the Tangle enables all nodes to retrieve all of a message's history, even the ones joining the network at a point later in time.

## 4.4.1 Naive approach
Approach:
1. Send solidification request for message immediately to all neighbors
2. If not received after `solidificationRetryInterval` seconds, send solidification request again. Repeat until received.

This approach simply requests missing messages recursively until all of them become solid. While easy to implement, it has some drawbacks. Each  parent that needs to be requested adds another RTT and message complexity (solidification request * neighbors). 

Optimizations:
- do not send solidification requests immediately: messages can arrive out of order but should generally arrive within a small time window, since other nodes only gossip messages on solidification.
- instead of asking for messages one by one, a node could ask for messages of a certain timeframe (e.g. its local snapshot time until now).
- send solidification requests only to a subset of neighbors.

## 4.4.2 Possible attacks
A malicious node can send unsolidifiable messages to a node. A simple protection is to only repeat solidification requests `solidificationMaxRepeat` times before the message gets deleted from the node's solidification buffer.
