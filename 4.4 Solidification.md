# 4.4 Solidification
A message is solid if all its parents are stored, solid and valid. This section defines how messages get solid in the Tangle.

## 4.4.1 Motivation
**Solidification** is a process of requesting missing referenced messages. It may be recursively repeated until all of a message's past cone up to the genesis (or snapshot) becomes solid.

In that way, the Tangle enables all nodes to retrieve all of a message's history, even the ones joining the network at a point later in time.

## 4.4.2 Definitions
* **valid**: A message is considered valid if it passes the following filters from the solidifier and from the message booker:
    * solidifier: it checks if parents are valid,
    * booker: it check if the contained transaction is valid. Notice that only messages containing a transaction are required to perform this check..
> TODO: link to message layout semantic check, and transaction syntactic/semantic check in ledgerstate spec.
* **parents age check**: A check that ensures the timestamps of parents and child are valid, following the details defined in Timestamp specification [Parent age check](#parent-age-check) 
> TODO: put the link of timestamp check
* **solid**: A message is solid if it passes parents age check and all its parents are stored in the storage, solid and valid.

## 4.4.3 Parameters 
* `retryInterval`: The time interval of resending the same solidification request.
* `maxRequestThreshold`: The maximum retry time to send a solidification request.

## 4.4.4 Detailed Design
During solidification, if a node is missing a referenced message, the corresponding message ID is stored in the `solidification buffer`. A node asks its neighbors for the missing message by sending a `solidification request` containing the message ID. Once the requested message is received from its neighbors, it shall be removed from the `solidification buffer`. The requested message is marked as solid after it passes the standard solidification checks. If any of the checks fails, the message remains unsolid. 

Nodes send and receive solidification request/response via gossip layer. The solidification request is scheduled by the gossip manager, if a node does not get the requested message, the gossip manager resends it every `retryInterval`. If the requested message is not received within `maxRequestThreshold` rounds, the `solidification request` must be removed from the `solidification buffer`.

Figure 4.4.4.1 shows the solidification process:

## 4.4.5 Request and response
Below we define the form of SolidificationRequest and SolidificationResponse: 

### SolidificationRequest
<table>
     <tr>
         <th>Name</th>
         <th>Type</th>
         <th>Description</th>
     </tr>
     <tr>
         <td>type</td>
         <td>uint8</td>
         <td>Defines the type of the SolidificationRequest. It indicates how gossip manager will process a received message.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
         <td>messageID</td>
         <td>ByteArray[32]</td>
         <td>contains the message ID of the requested message.</td>
     </tr>
 </table>

### SolidificationResponse
<table>
     <tr>
         <th>Name</th>
         <th>Type</th>
         <th>Description</th>
     </tr>
     <tr>
         <td>type</td>
         <td>uint8</td>
         <td>Defines the type of the SolidificationResponse. It indicates how gossip manager will process a received message.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
         <td>message</td>
         <td>ByteArray</td>
         <td>contains the entire requested message.</td>
     </tr>
 </table>
