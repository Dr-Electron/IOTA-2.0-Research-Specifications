# Tip Selection Algorithm 

## Introduction

The tip selection algorithm is the method by which messages are selected for approval by other issued messages joining the network.  This approval mechanism represents “belief” in the Tangle: If message y approves message x, this implies that y believes that x is valid and that its entire history is also valid. 

Although formerly the algorithm played a role in consensus during IOTA 1.0, this does not hold anymore. In IOTA 2.0 the tip selection plays the following role: to allow the Tangle to grow in a stable and secure way, with quick approval and finality times. 


We call the new Tip-Section algorithm "R-URTS", which means "Restricted Uniform Random Tip Selection". Here we summarize the main differences that the new Tip Selection Algorithm has, compared to the legacy version:

1. **Uniform Selection:** A change from the old Random Walk tip selection, we will use a much faster and simpler solution that will select uniformly among a subset of eligible tips. 
2. **Approval Switch Mechanism:** A new mechanism that will allow us to keep a clear tangle while avoid splittings due to disliked branches. 

In the following subsections we will explain the details about the number of parents and the uniform selection, while the approval switch mechanism is introduced in Section 4.1 - The Tangle. 

Although we will not be using here, the new message layout (more information in Section 2.2 - Message Layout) has the capabilities for a message to have a non-fixed number of messages that it approves (parents), which range from two to eight (compared to the fixed two parents in the legacy implementation). This can be used to develop tip spam protection mechanisms among other purposes. We will denote the number of parents being used in the algorithm by _Parental Number_. 

## Definitions

Here we will define some terminology that will be used through this section. 

- **Tip**: A message is considered a tip (by a node) if its selectable by the Tip Selection Algorithm, i.e. it is an element of any _Tip Pool_ (of that node).
- **Transaction Validity:** A transaction is valid if it passes the syntactical filter and its references are valid (see Section 2.3 - Payloads Layout for for information).
- **Individual Validity:** A message is considered _individually valid_ if it passed throught all the objective filters, i.e. the ones included in the Message Parser (see Section 2.4 - Data Flow).
- **Weak Validity:** A message is weakly valid if:
    - Its Individually Valid.
    - Its parents are weakly valid. 
    - Its transaction is Valid. 
    - It passes the `Parent Age Check`. 
- **Strong Validity:** See [Approval Switch ](#Approval_Switch).
- **Eligibility:** A Message is said _eligible_ if:
    - It is weakly valid;
    - It passes the timestamp check with level of knowledge at least 2;
    - All its parents are also eligible messages.

- **Liked Payload**: 

Observe that since validity depends only on objective filters, its classification is shared among all the nodes, while eligibility could have discrepancies as it depends on the local view (clock) of a node. 



## Tip Pools 

Recalling the definition of _tip_ on [Definitions](#Definitions), it says that the classification of a message as a tip is a product of the construction of the Tip Pools. Here we will define such filters and classifications that are used to make the Tip Pools. 

Differently from the legacy implementation, we will not have a single pool, but instead two, divided accoding to the new concenpt of the _Approval Switch_. 

We now present the theory of the approval switch, then define the many sets that are filtered in order to build the tip pools.

### Approval Switch 

One of the main improvements of the new Tip Selection Algorithm comes from its ability to keep both a clean non-conflicting subtangle, as well as to ignore the existence of conflicts in its selection, hence emulating the ability that Chrysalis' White Flag approach has of being unsplittable. In IOTA 2.0, those properties comes from the approval switch mechanism. In order to explain its functionality, we will define some terms:



- **Strong approval**: We say message $x$ strongly approves message $y$ if the issuer node from $x$ asserts that $y$ is monotonically liked.  
- **Weak approval**: We say message $x$ weakly approves message $y$ if the issuer node from $x$ asserts that $y$ contains a liked payload, but it is not monotonically liked.

Observe that the weak and strong approval also induce the concept of weak and strong parents, and with it the strong past cone. 

- **Strong Validity:** A message is strongly valid if:
    - It is weakly valid;
    - Its strong parents do not have a conflicting past;
    - Its strong parents are strongly valid. 


To properly define the tip pools, the understanding of Branches is required. Here we will give a summarized version of the definitions, that will be sufficient to understand the construction on the tip pools. We refer to Section X.X, Section 6.4 - Finalization and Section 5.1 - UTXO for the proper definitions about the following terms. 

- **Branch:** A non-conflicting strong past cone in the UTXO DAG. 

- **Message Pertinence:** A message belongs to a branch if and only if all conflicts in its strong past cone have transactions that belong to such branch.

- **(Message) Aggregated Branch:** The smallest branch that contains all conflicts in the strong past cone of a message.

- **Liked Transaction:** A transaction is considered liked if its aggregated branch achieved grade 2 final status. 

- **Individually Liked Branch**: A branch is individually liked if all conflicts that constitutes its aggregated branch are liked transactions. 

- **Monotonically Liked Branch**: A branch is monotonically liked if it and all the branches in its branch past are individually liked branches. 

- **Monotonically Liked Message**: A message is monotonically liked if its aggregated branch is monotonically liked.

In an heuristic way, one can think of a monotonically liked message as a  message that has a liked payload and that all other payloads that depends on it are also liked. 
With this we can classify the messages: 

- **Strong Messages**: We say a message $x$ is strong (for a node) if it is:
    - Eligible;
    - Monotonically liked with level of knowledge at least 2. 

- **Weak Messages**: We say a message $x$ is weak (for a node) it is:
    - Eligible;
    - Contains a liked payload;
    - It is not monotonically liked with level of knowledge at least 2.

### Construction of the Tip Pools 

We will define a sequence of pools, each one selected by filtering the previous one regarding one condition, until we conclude with the two elements used in the Tip Selection Algorithm: the _Strong Tips Pool_ and the _Weak Tip Pool_. 

1. **Valid Messages Pool:** The pool consisted of all messages that valid. 

2. **Eligible Messages Pool:** This pool consists of all messages that were also approved by the _Eligibility Check_ (see Section 2.4 - Data Flow and Section X.X).

3. **Liked Payload Pool:** This pool consists of all eligible messages that contains a payload tagged as "liked". 

4. **Strong Tips Pool**: This pool consists of all monotonically liked messages.

5. **Weak Tips Pool**: This pool consists of all messages from the _Liked Payload Pool_ that were not included in the _Strong Tips Pool_. 

The two main pools to be used by the tip selection algorithm are the _Strong Tips Pool_ and the _Weak Tips Pool_. Observe that from our definition, one pool in the list is always constructed by performing a filtering in the former one, but how this is performed is considered an implementation detail and hence will not be considered here further. 


### Update of the tip pools

There are two types of updates that can be done with the strong and weak tip pools:

1. **Removal**: Tips are removed when they are approved by other messages. This can happen in two ways:
     - When the node issues a message, the selected tips will be removed from the respective tip pools after the Tip Selection Algorithm is performed (we briefly explain the procedure in the [R-URTS](#R-URTS) subsection, further information may be found in the Section X.X - Message Generation).
     - When a new message is received, its parents shall be removed from the respective tip pools by the _Tip Manager_ application (further information may be found in the Section 2.4 - Data Flow).
2. **Rearrangement:** Tips can be changed from the strong tip pool to the weak tip pool, or from the weak tip pool to the strong tip pool if the perception of the branches they belong to changes, this is explained in more details in Section 6.5 - Node Peception Reorganization.

## Parental Number
To attach a new transaction to the Tangle, the algorithm needs to select and approve  between two and eight previous messages among a list of tips.
This defined a new variable, represented by $k$, that we will call the *Parental Number*.
The variation on the number of approvals (two to eight)  is there to counteract tip spam during low-congestion periods: A higher number of approvals can merge easier the spammer eligible messages with the tangle, keeping it growing in a healthy way. The standard parental number, $k_0$, is defined as two approvals and used on periods without tips spams. 
The detection and increase in parental number is individual per node, so the whole network does not need to achieve any kind of consensus on this and even if one attacker artificially changes the perception of nodes about spam, it does not creates any harm to the node itself (aside from a low impact on performance), and hence, in the network as a whole. 
### Tip Spam Detection
As part of its standard routines, a node needs to run periodically a spam detection routine `TipSpamDetection`, that will with certain confidence detects if a tip spam is happening and give the appropriate boolean response.  
A positive response from `TipSpamDetection` updates the associated counter metadata `TipSpamAge`, that checks for how many consecutive tests the spam has persisted, while a null answer from it will set  `TipSpamAge`.  Finally, `TipSpamDetection` will update the parental number according to the current value of `TipSpamAge`.

## R-URTS

We want to reiterate here that, ultimately, the tip selection is a free procedure not enforced by the protocol. Therefore each node may, if it sees worth, to select its approvees in a manual way or following another algorithm of its preference. What we will present here is the standard algorithm, that works both as a suggestion but also as something that the nodes will have implemented and will use by default. Since there is no consensus role being played by the Tip Selection Algorithm, differently from the legacy implementation, we strongly believe that such algorithm will also be used by the majority of the network. <!--Another discussion about this may be found in [Game Theory](#Game-Theory). -->

The selection algorithm to be used will be the RURTS (Restricted Uniform Random Tip Selection), which selects with uniform probability among the list of tips restricted by some condition.  

Tip Selection Algorithm with Parental Number $k$.

1. Consider the _Strong Tips Pool_ and the _Weak Tip Pools_ updated. 
2. The node shall select the first tip from the _Strong Tips Pool_.
3. The node shall select tips from numbered $2$ to $k$ from the union of the _Strong Tips Pool_ and the _Weak Tips Pool_.
4. The node shall register in the message's "Parents type" field if each selected parent was from the strong or weak tip pools.
5. The node shall remove the selected tips from their respective pools.
