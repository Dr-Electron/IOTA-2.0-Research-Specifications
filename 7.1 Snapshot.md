# 7.1 Snapshot

## 7.1.1 Introduction
This section defines the *Snapshot* protocol.


## 7.1.2 Dependencies
The *Snapshotting* protocol depends on:

+ Timestamps: Core module to enable pruning.
+ Tip Selection Algorithm: No messages can be referenced for the part of the Tangle that is being pruned.
+ UTXO: Transactions whose outputs are unspent, remain after the snapshot.
+ Branches: We require that the at the point of pruning only master branch and rejected branch exist.
+ Markers: We require that the part of the Tangle being pruned is not actively dependent on Markers any more. 
+ Approval weight: We require that the approval weight is concluded at a time much before messages reach the pruning age.
+ Voting: We require that any voting is concluded much before messages reach the pruning age. 
+ Data flow: A relaxed past cone check is applied.


## 7.1.3 Proof of Inclusion and Pruning

In order to keep the ledger concise, data that is sufficiently old can be removed. We call this process pruning. Thus, the IOTA 2.0 protocol for a standard node does not attempt to keep all information back until the Genesis. Rather the protocol effectively becomes a mechanism to prove whether a certain message was, at some point in the past, included in the ledger. This can be done e.g. through a Merkle tree proof. 

Transactions are payloads of value messages, for which a more complex pruning mechanism is used. Specifically when a transaction contains an unspent output, see [5.1. UTXO](./5.1%20UTXO.md), the transaction shall be kept when pruning the ledger. A transaction can be pruned if all its outputs are spent. An optimization of this process is possible by reducing the message to only keeping the information about the unspent outputs, however the implementation will be more complicated, and thus is not considered for this first iteration of the protocol.

## 7.1.5 Pruning dependencies

Pruning of messages is done when the messages reach the age `DELTA_PRUNE`. 

We require several conditions to be fulfilled in order to allow for a smooth pruning process: 
- Messages cannot attach to a message whose timestamp has an age difference of more than `DELTA`, see [4.3.4 R-URTS](./4.3%20Tip%20Selection%20Algorithm.md/#4.3.4%20R-URTS).
- Timestamp precision is enforced through voting, see [4.2.3 General Timestamp rules](./4.2%20Timestamps.md/#4.2.3%20General%20Timestamp%20rules). 
- Transaction must pass a relaxed past cone check, see [2.4.4.6 Booker - Point 7](./2.4%20Data%20Flow.md/#2.4.4.6%20Booker). 
- Finalization of messages must be guaranteed to happen before the point of pruning. Thus, any message must be either confirmed or rejected before the elapse of the pruning age. 
- Both the filtering out of messages with wrong timestamps, voting on conflicts, as well as the accumulation of sufficient approval weight takes a time much smaller than `DELTA_PRUNE`. 
- In order to allow a smooth pruning, any message at the age `DELTA_PRUNE` must either belong to the branch `masterBranch` or to a rejected branch. This simply means that messages are either confirmed or orphaned. 

With the above conditions we can safely assume any message before the time `DELTA_PRUNE>>DELTA` can be pruned. In summary this is for the following reasons:
- Timestamps are sufficiently accurate.
- Messages can only create parent-child relationships with messages that have a timestamp that is more recent than a predefined age.
- Branches are cleaned up at the depth of pruning, i.e. all messages that have pruning age are either confirmed or rejected.
- Transactions are only pruned once all of their outputs are confirmed spent. 


## 7.1.6 Pruning process

An output is considered *confirmed* spent, when the message containing a transaction spending it is confirmed. A flag `confirmedSpent` *shall* be set to `TRUE` in the metadata of the output when this event is triggered.

Once a message reaches the age `DELTA_PRUNE` several checks are performed:

+ If the message is a data message it can be removed. 
+ If the message is a value message and is rejected, i.e. is member of the `rejectedBranch` it can be removed.
+ If the message is a value message and is confirmed, i.e. is member of the `masterBranch` it is checked, whether any of the outputs is unspent, i.e. not confirmed spent. 
+ If all outputs are confirmed spent the value message is removed. 
+ If any of the outputs is unspent, i.e. not confirmed spent, the message *shall* be stored, and its references to parents are set to the `genesis`.

## 7.1.7 Post pruning

Transactions that are unspent at the time of pruning, remain in the database. Once all their outputs are confirmed spent, i.e. the flags `confirmedSpent` are `TRUE`, the transaction is deleted.
